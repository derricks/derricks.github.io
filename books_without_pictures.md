These books have minimal illustrations. Maybe none, maybe just on chapter headings. All are suitable, more or less, for kids 10 years or younger.


## _Love Sugar Magic_ series, Anna Meriano
We love this series about Leonora Logro√±o and her family of _bruja_ bakers in small-town Texas. The first book sees Leo learning
about the magic running through the women in her family as they all prepare for Dia de Los Muertos, and then misperforming her own magic to wild effect. There's a bit of sadness, though largely from Leo's friend, whose mom died from cancer before the book started. Mysteries and tense situations are resolved at a good pace, so young readers don't get too anxious or lose any threads. Fortunately, the book ends with recipes, because you'll want to eat something delicious as you read through!

## _Upside-Down Magic_ series, Sarah Mlynowski, Lauren Myracle, Emily Jenkins
Our daughter devoured this series, falling in love even before she opened the cover with its intensely adorable "dragon kitten" (or dritten.) Nory Horace lives in a world where magic is the norm. But while most people fall easily, predictably, and (one might say) boringly into a few categories with defined skills, Nory is different. Her magic goes "upside-down" or "wonky," much to the embarrassment of her family. She starts attending an Upside-Down Magic class with other kids whose magic doesn't do what it's "supposed" to. It's pretty clear early on that she and her friends represent really powerful magic, as their teacher (an "Upside-Down" person as well) tries to help them control, understand, and use their unique abilities. It's very easy to find parallels to neurodiverse students here, and in the first book there are hints that being different has been squashed in the last century of the world's history.

## _Saving Winslow_, Sharon Breen 
In theory, this is a great story for animal lovers: A child in a low-income suburban family nurses a sick donkey to full health until it can return to proper farm life. In practice, I felt like the text had an odd pacing that made it seem dreamlike. Passages of time would go by seemingly randomly. Without a lot of clues, you could be ahead a week or a month. Or maybe the whole book takes place in the span of a few weeks, but with no real context, it's hard to know. The neighbor girl who becomes a friend is given the barest rationale for her peculiar behavior. And, finally, I don't feel like you really get to know the titular donkey very well. Louie's attention to the donkey is a blatant and somewhat heavy-handed counterpoint to the fact that he misses his brother who's in the military.
