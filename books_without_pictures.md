## _Cattywampus_, Ash Van Otterloo
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yFy36RyBL._SX333_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Magic is recent history in Howler's Hollow, but not in a good way. The McGill and Hearn clans flung spells back and forth with such rancor and little regard for collateral damage that the townspeople banded together to put an end to it. Fast-forward to today, when Delpha McGill and Katybird Hearn are the last in line of their respective families. In Delpha's household, magic is strictly forbidden, but when she finds her family's spellbook, she sees it as a way to solve her mother's financial woes. Katybird, on the other hand, grew up knowing about magic, even if her family keeps it under wraps, but she's worried that her magic, which is passed from mother to daughter, will be okay, as she presents as female but was born with XY chromosomes. The two girls, who are at best acquaintances, meet up and accidentally unleash an undead army of both Hearns and McGills, who bring the full fury of the feud back with them. The girls have to work together and master their magic in order to save their town. The arc feels like it takes a beat too long to resolve, and it's unclear what the girls have to do assuage the angry townspeople once the zombies are quieted, but it's a good story overall.

## _The Tragical Tale of Birdie Bloom_, Temre Beltz
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EW3Hbx0NL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I really liked this fantasy book, though I'd be hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly why. Certainly the underlying themes of the power of friendship and combatting rigid definitions of who you are are good ones. And the book provides a novel take on the "imagine a world where fairly tale characters are real" genre of middle grade books. And the quippy narrator, who is in fact the book you're reading, provides amusing editorials and footnotes. In Wanderly, Caucasian (by the cover if not the text) Birdie Bloom is a Tragical. Stories in Wanderly are fiercely controlled by the Chancellor. And you are destined to live the story written for you. Not all stories are happy, of course, which is where Tragicals come in: they are destined to have unhappy endings (unlike the Triumphants, winners of happy endings and suspiciously often drawn from upper classes). So Birdie lives a bleak existence, because why invest in teaching Tragicals how to do anything other than die unhappily? But then the _deus ex machina_ of the Winds of Wanderly, a sort of omnipresent anything-is-possible magical entity, brings Birdie a letter written by a wicked witch who wants more from the book of spells than the Chancellor has allowed. A bit of initial identity confusion moves the two pen pals to form the most unlikely of friendships. The headmistress of the Home for Tragicals is like Miss Hannigan turned up to a million (minus the drunkenness), so she can be a scary character. But even she is given depth by the uplifting (and decidedly non-Tragical) end of the book, with a suppressed magical ability that brings to mind people forced to hide their homosexuality for fear of abuse.

## _The Tail of Emily Windsnap_, Liz Kessler
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5157P0O-rWL.jpg)

This middle-grade fantasy series will definitely appeal to mermaid enthusiasts, as the titular character learns that she's half-mermaid when she plunges fully into the water for the first time in her life. Before long, she's made a mermaid BFF and started to unwind a conspiracy about her father, a neighbor, her mother's odd memory lapses, and Neptune himself. The plot moves along through coincidence after coincidence, and raises a lot of questions, but if your child likes this kind of thing, this series is sure to be a hit. (Our daughter read the first two books but then got bored by the third.)

## _The 1,000 Year Old Boy_, Ross Welford
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51B7uBL7wSL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

["Who waaaants to live foreveeeeer?" asks Queen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jtpf8N5IDE) Not Alfie. Not anymore. A thousand years before the book's time frame, Alfie used a "life pearl" that stopped him aging. He was 11 at the time. And in modern times, he still looks like an 11-year-old. But when his mom (also ageless) dies in a fire, he sets in motion a plan they established hundreds of years before: find the last life pearl they had hidden and set himself aging again. He recruits two kids in the neighborhood, and the three spend the latter third of the book tensely dodging another Neverdead who has stumbled onto Alfie and wants the life pearl for himself, archaeologists about to excavate the very site Alfie needs to visit, the modern kids' parents, and child protection services. This book dwells effectively on the ups and downs of agelessness (which is different than immortality), and offers a sobering, thoughtful look on what that life might be like.

## _The True Meaning of Smekday_, Adam Rex
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JI5aukuCL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

It's not hard to spot similarities between this book and _Mars Evacuees_ (below). In both, aliens have come to Earth and begun to corral humans. A human and an alien become friends, and then the two races have to work together to defeat yet another group of aliens. This book makes more explicit parallels between how the aliens treat the humans and how European colonists treated Native Americans, with humans put onto reservations, policies changed at the last moment, and so on. This book is a more humorous narrative, though, with Black protagonist Gratuity Tucci befriending a Boov who goes by J. Lo and eats all manner of things we don't consider food (including sure-to-induce-giggles items such as urinal cakes). This book has a draggy middle part -- I don't understand what the Florida side trip added to the story other than a satirical look at a thinly-disguised Disneyland (Happy Mouse Kingdom) and probably 100 pages -- but is mostly enjoyable and packed with silly sci-fi. It is evidently the basis of the movie _Home_, but reading the plot summary of that movie brings the phrase "loosely based on" to mind.

## _A Tale of Highly Unusual Magic_, Lisa Papademetriou
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Yed9F2KnL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This book gives you three stories for the price of one! Kai and Leila, two girls who don't know each other and are situated halfway around the world from each other for most of the book, each find a blank copy of a book called _The Exquisite Corpse_. When Kai, on an impulse, writes a sentence in her copy, not only does Leila see it and write her own sentence, the book itself begins to fill in its own story, incorporating elements of the girls' lives. While the girls never learn of each other, they do each realize that they have their own connections to the real people described by the magical book's story. Elements from one girl's experiences bleed into the other's in a magical realism way. There's much in this book about magic hidden in the world around us.

## _Amari and the Night Brothers_, B.B. Alston
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51f5PWfVZoL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

When Amari gets a mysterious package on behalf of the brother she was told was dead, she finds an invitation to join the top-secret Bureau of Supernatural Investigations. She accepts so she can find out what happened to her brother, but quickly discovers that she is a Magician, a human with innate magical powers. Unfortunately, Magicians are viewed as unilaterally evil by the Bureau, so she immediately faces the same level of shunning and disparagement she faced as a Black girl in a largely white prep school.  Bureau officials allow her to try out to be an agent, and she pairs with classmate Dylan van Helsing and her were-dragon roommate to find out what happened to her brother as well as Dylan's sister Maria. If you liked the _Nevermoor_ books, you'll find a lot of similarities in this rich, fast-paced novel. My daughter tore through this and was excited to tell us all about it as she read it.

## _Toaff's Way_, Cynthia Voigt
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pn9RILqjL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Oh, I loved the language in this squirel's-eye-view story -- a more common genre of middle-grade fiction than you'd expect -- right out of the gate. "Sometimes everything was so wonderful all you could do was whuffle." "...the squirrel voices were filled with slow churring sounds, not at all like the quick chuk-chukkings in his own den..." The rich soundscape of the farm where the book is set is on constant display. Cows muuh muuh, sheep bua bua, and dogs mostly yark. Or Yark! The farm is a wide world for the curious Toaff, who doesn't just accept the things he's told at face value. As the meditative story unfolds -- the book spans a year of Toaff living his life -- Toaff explores more of the farm and meets more of its denizens, all of whom have views about the world that sound humorous to our ears -- my daughter was in stitches about the idea that the sheep had kidnapped a human to take care of them -- but make sense from that tiny corner of the farm. There are some moments of scariness, but overall this is a gentle story that will let you see the world in a new light. Some cartoon-esque drawings scattered through the book give an extra touch of life to the narrative.

## _Castle Hangnail_, Ursula Vernon
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HMOJjmnUL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I don't know that I can set up the premise better than the official description: "When Molly shows up on Castle Hangnail's doorstep to fill the vacancy for a wicked witch, the castle's minions are understandably dubious. After all, she is twelve years old, barely five feet tall, and quite polite." This is a sweet story about a young girl who is _maybe_ not quite as wicked as she claims to be. Though she is there because she stole -- sort of? -- the invitation to become Mistress of the titular castle. And she does have very Witchy boots. But despite the minions' skepticism, Molly uses a tome of spells to win their trust and the hearts of the townspeople nearby, while also saving the castle from being decommissioned and realizing that the "friend" who helped her learn magic was manipulative and mean. Ursula Vernon writes often for the middle grade set, and she knows her audience. Jokes are aimed at kids but not overly gross, and the whole thing is quite gentle and easy. Definitely one for the Goth parents who will share Molly's appreciation for black lace and dusty, gloomy castles.

## _Murder is Bad Manners_, Robin Stevens
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N-7UP3izL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This clear homage to Agatha Christie books moves the action to a girls' school in the 1930s and sets two middle-graders, Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong, as the detectives solving the crime. My daughter really enjoys this series. When Hazel discovers a dead body in the school gym, the two girls go to work to solve the mystery. Suspects are brought up and eliminated, clues are followed, and various leads get misinterpreted until the final reveal. I don't know how easy the right answer is to get on one's own; my daughter told me the ending before I read the book. Daisy is that insufferable pretty, upper-class child who everyone adores and gets away with anything she wants, more or less, and is clearly accustomed to that devotion. Hazel definitely faces some racism at the school -- she's from Hong Kong -- but it's a side thread and probably better represents Hazel's day-to-day experience as it would be at that time period.

## _Once Upon a Unicorn_, Lou Anders
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jvo7zeCNL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I thought I had the measure of this book pretty early. _Enemy Mine_ trope between the main unicorn and the night mare -- two species who can't stand each other -- plus a snarky, fourth-wall-breaking narrator. I figured it would be fun and fluffy. But actually the story takes some complicated turns that made for a richer, deeper story that builds on top of darker western European stories of Faerie. While none of the plot twists are particularly surprising, this is a book that has some depth but always stays pretty fun.

## _Mars Evacuees_ series, Sophia McDougall
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519DIS-BupL._SX333_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

One of my favorite things about this series was hearing my daughter try to pronounce the words and names from the alien species presented within. But aside from that, this is a pretty solid middle grade sci-fi book. Alice Dare, daughter of one of the most famous pilots fighting against the Morror aliens who have begun to take over Earth, is sent to Mars with a few hundred other kids to train as cadets. But a few months into their training, all the adults leave. Alice finds herself in a _Lord of the Flies_ situation and leaves the base to find the adults along with her super-smart (and notably Black) friend Josephine, class clown Carl and his brother, and one of the teaching robots. While terraforming has begun on Mars, it's still early and the kids have a tough go of it. Along the way, they meet a Morror and learn more about why the Morror came to Earth at all. By the end of the book, the Earthlings and Morror have teamed up against a common threat, thanks to the kids, and book two sees them meeting yet more aliens en route to a new Morror homeworld.

## _The Lost Treasure of Tuckernuck_, Emily Fairlie
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yIiPRa0pL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I would like to go to a school that has a decades-old treasure hunt buried in its walls and has a notable Victorian architecture. But Laurie, the main protagonist (Caucasian, like everyone pictured in the book), at first wants nothing to do with her new school; she'd much rather transfer to Hamilton, where her best friend goes. An accident, however, leads her and fellow "Clucker" Bud to the first clue of the founder's treasure hunt, which is farther than anyone's gotten before. The treasure hunt is fun in this book, but, much like _York_ (see below), the treasure seekers seem to often happen across solutions by luck and without a lot of solving. In fact, they often seem poised to give up at the slightest challenge. While the characters are going through typical middle-grade challenges, I didn't really feel like I got to know them very well. Still, there are fun antics and asides that kept my daughter laughing and eager to read the sequel.

## _The Inventors at No. 8_, A. M. Morgen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513jJqZwXpL._SX339_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

George, the 3rd Lord of Devonshire, has resigned himself to a dull life trapped in his home because of the curse of bad luck he believes he's stuck with. And then Ada Byron, the future Ada Lovelace, enters his life. She buys a map that is his last possession and purports to tell the location of the Star of Victory, a maginificent jewel. The two set off to recover the gem with Ada's friend Oscar and his organutan companion Ruthie. Their adventure takes them to Switzerland and Venice as they dodge the shadowy Organization and damage their friendship. The adventure itself is one of those silly things where it seems like everyone in Europe manages to know everyone else, and can be a bit convoluted to follow, but it's a lot of fun and has numerous twists and turns.

## _Front Desk_ series, Kelly Yang
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dN99OdBtL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This series starts out with the semiautobiographical story of Mia Tang, a girl whose parents brought her from China to forge a better life. Unfortunately, racism and anti-immigration sentiment in the United States have made for hard going. But the motel where they've started working offers some hope. At least until the Chinese-born owner proves he's just as willing to exploit them as native-born managers. Mia fumes at his callous and racist attitudes. When she applies to an essay-writing contest that looks to be a ticket out of her family's drudgery, she discovers that writing -- even as a non-native English speaker -- is a skill that can be deployed in other ways as well. Pretty soon, she's writing letters to help her friends, right wrongs, and build a community around her. The second book, _Three Keys_ zooms out a bit to talk about how anti-immigration sentiment affects many lives, particularly her friend Lupe's, but once again Mia rallies a community of kind people, many of them recent immigrants themselves. Mia is a great character: determined, creative, and possessed of a strong moral compass. And these books grip you emotionally with the ups and downs of her family's struggles.

## _Property of the Rebel Librarian_, Allison Varnes
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yrrRk80KL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Oooh, this book had me fuming and exclaiming in outrage at every point. When protagonist June Harper's parents find an "inappropriate" (maybe just scary?) book in her backpack, they go on a rampage to not only stop her from reading such books but to purge the school library of any texts they deem unacceptable. They take away June's personal books and eventually return Bowdlerized versions with words crossed out, pages removed, and index cards with new endings pasted over the original pages. (_Old Yeller_ now ends with "And they lived happily ever after.) But June almost accidentally begins a subversive counterattack, eventually pulling a huge section of the student body into her network of enthusiastic readers. It grows and grows until the inevitable denouement. While the situation doesn't wrap up neatly, it does leave June feeling independent and sure of herself in a way that she didn't at the beginning of the book. (And an overheard conversation suggests that her parents are both disappointed in her trouble-making but proud of how she comports herself when owning up to it.) Her lack of self-definition manifests as well in her crush on a wealthy boy who turns out to be a narcissistic bozo. A better relationship appears in the form of her underground library's first patron and co-founder. There is much in the way of heterosexual middle-grade romance drama here, but also a lot of good opportunity to talk about reading, censorship, and what is right and wrong when it comes to controlling kids. There is a bibliography of banned books mentioned in the text.

## _Strange Birds_, Celia C. Pérez
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PUERVQetL._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

When Lane DiSanti decides to start a scout troop of sorts in her small Florida town, she ends up with an eclectic mix of four girls who serve as a counterpoint to "the Floras", a historic socialite society for girls. The girls decide on an activist path that puts them on a collision course with the Floras, centering around a hat made out of bird feathers that dates back a hundred years or so. In addition to standard middle-grade themes of finding your own way and what constitutes friendship and meaning, the four girls represent a wide range of social perspectives that they are aware of and honest about. Aster, who is Black, talks often about "the Wall," the invisible divide that separates the poor, largely Black side of town from the White side of town where, for instance, the DiSantis, a founding family of the town, live. Lane, meanwhile, is oblivious to her privilege and the town's history. Cat, the bird enthusiast and former Flora, is a Cuban-American whose mother sees in her daughters a chance to continue their family's social climb by participation in the Floras. Ofelia's overprotective Latina mom works as an aide for Mrs. DiSantis. But the girls bond over their protests against the Floras and a desire for justice. And while no statues are torn down, the attempts to educate people about the mass extinction of birds that took place because of decorative hats has similar tones of re-evaluating historic icons and what it says to ignore that past.

## _A Pinch of Magic_, Michelle Harrison
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515Wkxc7QEL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

When Betty Widdershins learns the women of her family are cursed to never be able to leave their small community, she becomes determined to break the curse -- especially after her two sisters are kidnapped to beyond the boundary, starting the clocks ticking on their imminent death. The three sisters are aided by three magical items that give them the ability to turn invisible, see far afield, or travel anywhere instantly. This is a tense adventure -- the omens of impending death add a lot of anxiety and stress to an already fraught situation --  that celebrates sisterhood, teamwork, and empathy. See my [full review on GeekDad](https://geekdad.com/2020/10/review-a-pinch-of-magic-delivers-sisters-sorcery-and-suspense/).

## _The Dark Lord Clementine_, Sarah Jean Horwitz
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sl5iSH70L._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

The premise of this is clever: What does your life look like if you're the daughter of a Dark Lord and heir to his power, title, and estate? Clementine lives alone with her father and is gradually learning what she needs to become a Dark Lord in her own time. But when her father gets cursed by a nearby witch, Clementine has to take on more of the estate's responsibilities. She decides to figure out how to save him, and wanders off to find a cure. In the first act, numerous characters think about killing the nearby unicorn, though that confrontation doesn't take place until the third act. In the second, Clementine makes new friends -- which Dark Lords are _not_ supposed to do -- and begins to build not only a new "family" but also the confidence to find her own way. Early on, it's clear that Clementine isn't exactly standard Dark Lord fare, so don't worry about rooting for the bad guy (or girl). Rather, the book touches on familial love even when nontraditional, the power of friendships, and the desire for independence.

## _The Ministry of S.U.I.Ts_, Paul Gamble
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GcEx-Sv3L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Picture _Men in Black_, but written for middle graders and filtered through a lens of _Monty Python_, Douglas Adams, and other absurdist humor influences, and you'll probably get pretty close to the tone of this book. Northern Irish protagonist Jake is an observant kid who wonders about all sorts of things, and makes logical leaps that seem bizarre to our ears but, in the world of this book, end up being pretty much exactly right. These bounds lead him to become a member of the Ministry of Strange, Unusual, and Impossible Things where, along with fellow schoolmate Trudy, he uncovers a massive plot based on clues such as smelly gym clothes. The twists and turns are, unsurprisingly, unpredictable and silly, and equally silly footnotes and sidebars show up frequently. There's some fat-shaming and other elements that feel a bit lazy (thuggish male Tooth Fairy in a pink tutu), but overall this is a zany adventure that my daughter really enjoyed.

## _Girls Who Code_ series, Stacia Deutsch
![](https://www.amazon.com/Friendship-Code-Girls-Who/dp/0399542515)

The slim books in this series hold fairly typical upper-elementary/middle-grade themes -- friendship, collaboration, misunderstanding -- set against a backdrop of girls learning to program and make their ideas come to life. This book is enthusiastic about girl programmers: Lucy's mom is a programmer, and the coding club she's in seems to be predominantly girls, all of different races and backgrounds. The first book walks you through the key things you need to know about programming: input/output, conditionals, loops, and variables. But not in any recognizable programming language, which is obviously part of the point; those concepts exist in every language. One thing I really enjoyed about this series is that everyone is full of ideas about programs they want to write. It's not just about writing a game, which is where most "get kids coding" efforts start, but about writing programs that solve a problem, whether it's reminding a beloved relative to take their medicine or helping sick kids get homework from classmates. I feel like this really respects kids' ideas and helps underscore the fact that programming is a tool that can help across a wide swath of problems relevant to their lives.

## _The Uncommers_ series, Jennifer Bell
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lutenOeBL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

As the book starts, Ivy Sparrow is riding in an ambulance with her grandmother Sylvie, who has taken a tumble. But at the hospital, she notices an odd man in gray with mangled hands. Then her grandmother's house gets raided. And officers in black regalia show up wielding toilet brushes. Before long, Ivy has found herself in Lundinor, a city thriving well under London, right in time for an undermart, where a group of people who call themselves uncommoners trade magical objects a couple times a year. Uncommon lemon squeezers cast light, uncommon belts let you fly, and uncommon bells give you helpful advice. Ivy and her brother find themselves in a race to rescue her parents from the evil Dirge, who are _very_ interested in what happened to Grandma Sylvie decades before. The blurbage for this says "For anyone with a Hogwarts-sized hole in their heart," and I can see similarities. Everyday objects with magical powers, a fantastic world right under our noses, and odd attire. Perhaps it was simply the timing of the first book's arrival that invited the comparison; there are plenty of differences (even beyond having a girl as protagonist) and Lundinor is its own world with plenty of unique elements. The books are fast-paced adventures that will have you at the edge of your seat and jealous of Ivy's magical experiences. There are a handful of wonderful illustrations throughout to catch the eye.

## _Granted_, John David Anderson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BR0gSsxlL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I was taken with this book from its very beginning, with its meditation on wishes and its imaginative bustling fairy city. Even the names -- Ophelia Delphinium Fidgets is our protagonist -- get a moment of explanation. When Ophelia, a "Granter" who actually grants wishes and keeps magic flowing, sets off on her first wish-granting mission, she's thrilled and fairly cocky about it. Given that her mission starts off early in the book, it's not hard to imagine that it quickly goes off the rails. One might imagine something like _The Night Fairy_, and there are similarities, but Ophelia isn't a naive, wondering observer of the human world. Fairies who leave Haven need to study up on humans and our customs and devices. But Ophelia learns that book smarts and training can only take you so far. One is reminded of Wesley Wyndham-Price, in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, bragging upon his arrival that he has faced two vampires. Under controlled circumstances, of course. Ophelia goes from dogmatic rule follower determined to complete her mission to independent thinker determined to do the right thing, and you'll find yourself solidly on the side of the rule breaking she does at the end. The book is filled with humor -- Ophelia's magic fairy song that beguiles listeners is _Crazy Train_ -- warmth, and touches of sorrow, and it has a deeper message about home and happiness. Note for sensitive readers: The dog she meets on her adventures has clearly been abandoned and abused. Not horribly, but enough to give him a sobering backstory and in turn make him distrustful of human loyalty.

## _Kiranmala and the Kingdom Beyond_ series, Sayantani DasGupta
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61poA1QzOxL._SX342_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This will inevitably invite comparison to _Aru Shah_ (see below). Both feature South Asian tween girls flinging pop culture references left and right while embarking on an adventure steeped in an Indian mythology after learning they're royalty of some form or another. But the _Kiranmala_ books are more about Bengali myths, which may or may not be lost on the average Western reader. Kiranmala is also older than Aru Shah and is noticing boys -- especially cute boys -- more than her Rick-Riordan-stamped contemporary. The settings in the _Kiranmala_ books are also more bonkers, involving trips through interdimensional pathways and describing scientific concepts such as neutron stars and black holes as gems and demons that we can't understand in our 2D world where we want simple explanations. The _Kiranmala_ books are fast-moving adventures that take twists and turns and ultimately talk about tolerance for others and feature a princess who wears combat boots and abhors the Pretty Pink Princess line of toys. There is artwork sprinkled throughout, but drawings are few and far between.

## _Casey Grimes: The Mostly Invisible Boy_, AJ Vanderhorst
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41gXTt5XZ2L._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Casey Grimes has spent the school year lonely and frustrated by his near-invisibility. If he makes a loud noise, a fellow student might notice him for up to a few seconds. But then it will be as if he didn't exist. His loneliness spurs him deep into the nearby forest, where he finds and climbs a monstrous oak tree. High up in its branches, he discovers a magical world named Sylvan Woods, where the parents are off at "the front" battling nightmare versions of our forest wildlife and the kids are learning how to take their own positions as defenders of the forests and "Civilians" such as Casey and ourselves. There's lots of nature appreciation in this book, as well as adventure and magic. You can read [my longer review at GeekDad](https://geekdad.com/2020/08/review-casey-grimes-1-the-mostly-invisible-boy/).

## _Caley Cross and the Hadeon Drop_, Jeff Rosen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518s-OpM+sL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Caley Cross is just your typical Caucasian 13-year-old at the beginning of this book, the first in a new series. Except for the fact that she lives in an abusive orphanage and can reanimate dead animals. But after one such zombie incident, she's whisked off to the world of Erinath, where it turns out she's the long-lost highest-ranking princess, daughter of the former Queen. In Erinath, children bond with creatures -- their "baests" -- who shape their magic and their lives in unique ways. While she soon makes some fast friends, she also soon meets a mean girl intent on humiliating her and learns that an evil Watcher is after her. There are some fat jokes, and one characters whose whole existence seems to be so the authors can mock "political correctness," but this is a fast-paced adventure story with many thematic elements in common with Harry Potter. You can read [my longer GeekDad review as well](https://geekdad.com/2020/08/review-caley-cross-and-the-hadeon-drop/).

## _Freya and the Magic Jewel_, Joan Holub & Suzanne Williams
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MxP-nAFXL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I checked out this book because I was drawn to cover art of a blond goddess with a twinkle in her eye in a chariot pulled by tabby cats. But the story reduces the Norse god of love and beauty to a ditzy teenager enrolled in Asgard Academy. Who! Narrates! Her Life! With! Lots of! Exclamation Points. My daughter enjoyed this middle-grade Disney-esque view of Norse mythology -- first in a series -- well enough, but I found the book teeth-gratingly annoying and the primary character mostly unlikeable.

## _Mrs. Smith's Spy School for Girls_, Beth McMullen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-WF-6r4LL._SX333_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This book starts off a bit slower than you'd expect from the description, but by the middle of the book it's a tense series of narrow escapes from duplicitous villains, with a few twists thrown in for good measure. Abigail Hunter, the smart and smart-aleck Caucasian narrator of the book, has been shipped off to a prestigious boarding school in Connecticut. But she soon discovers that there's a school within the school: one focused on using girls and young women as spies "because no one notices kids." She also discovers that her mom is actually one of the spy school's most legendary alumni and has gone missing. She's set up as bait to get her mom to resurface -- ideally along with crucial information about beating the mysterious Ghost criminal mastermind. This is book one of a series.

## _Grounded: The True Adventures of Rapunzel_, Megan Morrison
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514QX0NciaL._SX338_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

You know the story of Rapunzel, but what about all the people affected by her loss and the story of her imprisonment? And why exactly did the witch keep her in the tower? When this book's Rapunzel descends from her tower along with Jack (of the beanstalk), nearby fairies set her on a quest and forbid her from contacting the only love she's ever known: Witch, who keeps her in her tower and tells her horrible tales of the world below. (This is an amusing reversal of the "I'm a mistreated nobody in my own life, but someone special in this other one" genre of middle-grade fantasy.) But, as you might imagine, Rapunzel soon learns that the world has many good things and that Witch is more than just a loving parent. Is in fact something more sinister and feared by the people of Tyme. Rapunzel's quest seems to go relatively easily, with few things being scary for very long, and she is often helped along by good people who know her story (who, refreshingly, are described as being a wide range of human races), but I really liked the way this book meditates on family and love and how complicated it can be. There's a lot of clever ideas in these books.

## _Dragon Pearl_, Yoon Ha Lee
![](https://www.amazon.com/images/I/51zw8TvctML._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Protagonist Min is a real fox. A supernatural fox that is, one of the magical creatures drawn from Korean mythology that accompanied humans to the stars. While most of the supernaturals -- dragons, tigers, goblines, and more -- have found places in society, albeit not always to the comfort of their human colleagues, foxes are viewed with suspicion and most people think they're extinct. Foxes like Min can shape shift and use Charm to influence the feelings of humans and supernaturals alike. While her mother urges her to repress her Fox powers, Min must bring them fully into play when she sets off to rescue her brother Jun, a Space Forces soldier accused of deserting his post in order to go after the fabled Dragon Pearl, which has the ability to terraform planets quickly and easily. This is a well-written, fast-moving space opera, full of adventure, twists, and shifting alliances. While complete in itself, the book does set up for sequels. In an _au courant_ nod, Lee's universe's ID cards contain pronoun preferences for the person, and, indeed, a significant character prefers gender-netural they/their/theirs.

## _The Twelve_, Cindy Lin
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512v60-n2FL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In our world, astrology is total fiction. But in this first book in a series, being born in, say, the Year of the Rabbit might give you rabbit-like powers. Usagi (the whole cast is implied to be of Asian descent) is one such girl with zodiac powers; she can hear quiet noises from far away and make tremendous leaps. When her sister is abducted by the Dragon Lord, who has seemingly purged the land of those with zodiac talents, she has to journey to Mount Jade to master her powers and rescue her sister. This book is a solid adventure with lots of magic and martial arts, and the story takes some twists, though adults may see them coming. It sets up nicely for the sequel, which we're looking forward to and promises a [Catradora-esque](https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/Catradora#:~:text=Catra%20and%20Adora%20were%20childhood,children%2C%20they%20were%20always%20together.&text=Adora%20told%20her%20to%20stop%2C%20but%20Shadow%20Weaver%20kept%20on%20going.) antagonism -- but without the lesbian denouement -- along with a magical-item scavenger hunt. My daughter really liked this story.

## _Code Busters Club_ series, Penny Warner
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+DU8pJ9EL._SX338_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

If your kid is going through their inevitable secret code phase, they may enjoy this series about four multiethnic kids who like to solve codes, ciphers, and other puzzles. The mysteries are pretty straightforward for adult readers and bigger kids, but throughout the book you'll find coded messages that you can solve right along with the characters. If you get stuck, the back of the book has keys to help you along, and if you get _really_ stuck, the books also feature the answers. There's a bit of stereotyping here: the Asian kid is good with computers, the Black kid is athletic and from the South. There's also some heteronormative crushing between protagonist Cody and Luke, and at one point in the first book, ME suggests to Cody that her nemesis is mean to her because he likes her, which is not okay messaging for girls. Still, this series features way more codes and ciphers than other similar books, and even a secret codes devotee is sure to learn some things from them.

## _Unicorn Quest_ series, Kamilla Benko
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51byPHzp5XL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

It doesn't take too long for this book to get going as Claire and her big sister Sophie (both drawn as Caucasian on the cover) climb a ladder they find in their great-aunt's fireplace and end up in an entirely different world. Benko's Arden is a wonderfully constructed world, with four magical guilds that, in modern times, are tensely peaceful but don't intermingle. Claire, the younger sister, figures out that Sophie has been going back to Arden on her own and sets out find her and bring her home. Along the way, the sisters encounter perilous situations and twists aplenty while also learning of their own connections to the magical land. The text in this moves along smoothly, and Claire is a likable, well-fleshed-out, independently-minded character. My daughter and I both really liked these books. I wrote a [longer review for GeekDad](https://geekdad.com/2020/07/review-the-unicorn-quest-by-kamilla-benko/).

## _Wildwood Chronicles_, Colin Meloy
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61h-DHwyNmL._SX385_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Portland-based Prue (drawn as Caucasian which I suppose makes sense for Portland) is babysitting her toddler brother one day when a murder of crows descends upon the wagon he's in and carries him away to the Impassable Wilderness (the book's analog to the parks and forests south and west of the city across the Willamette). When Prue sets out to rescue him, she and her friend Curtis (possibly bi-racial, hard to know) quickly find themselves in a separate land whose citizens are engaged in a power play involving a corrupt government in the South; bandits; a power-hungry Dowager-Governess; the Avian Principality; and the rural, peaceful North Wooders. The two (who are separated soon after they enter the woods) get involved in battles both small and large and make new alliances and enemies, and Prue learns more about her own connections to the land. There are similarities to _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, especially with regards to the talking animals and the first book's Dowager-Governess and her White Witch-esque antics. I'm not sure how I feel about the only other main female character being a [trope-y woman driven mad by the loss of her son who is now bent on world-destroying vengeance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen), but I actually think the book has some good things to say about the deeper complexities going on politically, and more girls are introduced as principals as the series continues. It's certainly a good adventure! And the third book ends after an epic conflict. If you're familiar with Meloy's songs for The Decemberists, you won't be surprised to find that the Wildwood world is quirky and rich. This book does have very lovely illustrations, but it's a hefty book in its own right (at the time, probably the largest book my daughter had read), so I've kept it here.

## _Aru Shah and the End of Time_, Roshani Chokshi
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KHFiAY7OL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Part one of a series under the Rick Riordan stamp, which is basically him taking the fame he garnered writing Greek mythology fanfic and helping boost people writing about other mythologies. In this case, Aru Shah is of Indian descent and, it turns out, one of the reincarnated Pandavas. Once she lights a cursed lamp to prove to her classmates she's not lying (which she often does), she is thrust into a quest with another Pandava reincarnation (all girls, in this series) to defeat the awakened Sleeper before he stops all time. The series (of which I've read book one but my daughter has read one and two) is full of references to pop culture and Hindu stories, at least the ones the author heard as a child, according to her author's note where she notes the difficulty of nailing down "one version" of Hindu mythology. I have to say I wasn't overly fond of Aru Shah (the girl) when I started the book, but I ultimately came around. She starts out as whiney and a bit unrepentant but does eventually find her footing, even if she doesn't exactly succeed the way you'd expect.

## _The Vanderbeekers of 141st Street_, Karina Glaser
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5108wsGtt4L._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This series is often compared to the Penderwicks (see below), and it's not hard to see why: a sprawling group of siblings having everyday escapades and managing their relationships with each other and their lives. But while the Penderwicks are, as a friend says, "not just white but New England white" who vacation in the Berkshires, the Vanderbeekers are a biracial family living in one apartment in a New York City brownstone. The first book sees them trying to prevent their family from getting evicted at the holidays, and I really liked it. The family is quirky and boisterous, with diverse personalities among the kids. They're engaged with their wider community and the social issues facing it. The way they tackle their problems is what you'd expect from modern-day kids. The family felt real and warm.

## _Greenglass House_, Kate Milford
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cZKEM4eRL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I liked this first book in a series quite a lot and stayed up late one night finishing it. On the surface, it's a decent closed circle mystery featuring a number of guests who get themselves to the titular house -- in the book an inn frequented by smugglers -- for various personal reasons tied to the house's history. But those reasons begin to come out as guests find their belongings stolen. Milo, the owners' son, investigates the thefts with the help of his friend Meddy. By the end of the book, you'll have gotten an in-depth look at the house's history, a good sense of the many guests, and a burning desire to visit the fictional house and hole up there with a good book. Though arguably set in contemporary times -- the war of 1812 is referred to as "a couple hundred years ago" and the house has a backup generator -- there are definitely some magical elements that get stronger as the series progresses, and trappings of the modern world such as cell phones are absent. One thing I quite liked about the book is that Milo and Meddy turn the investigation into a roleplaying game, and the author often uses their character names in the narration, as Milo in particular imagines himself as his alter ego and thinks like him. (Note that Milo is adopted and of Chinese descent, but the author deliberately didn't make that the whole point of the book. Still it's a strong undercurrent and informs a lot of his reactions.)

## _Book Scavenger_, Jennifer Chambliss Bertman
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AOnqfVOPL._SX318_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Imagine [geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play) for bookworms, and you'll have a sense of the Book Scavenger game that protagonist Emily loves to play (and that [you can, too, in this world](https://bookscavenger.com/)). People hide books and then leave clues about where they could be found. The person who finds it logs it and sends it on its way. But when Emily (who seems Caucasian, but that could just be my own bias) comes across an unusual book soon after her move to San Francisco, it turns out that it's a new, unannounced game from the Book Scavenger creator. But other people want the great treasure promised by the book, and Emily and her new friend James (of Chinese descent) have to balance a new friendship, an all-consuming puzzle, and thugs looking to cash in. While the plot is straightforward and enjoyable, I really like the way Bertman writes about the actual process of puzzle-solving. Aside from a perplexing passage in the beginning (why would you rearrange letters if you know something is a substitution cipher?), Bertman clearly knows what it's like to go on a puzzle hunt. Sometimes inspiration strikes in weird ways. Sometimes you just have to grind through the mechanics. Sometimes you turn to Google. Sometimes you need a friend's perspective. A parallel thread about a classwide cipher challenge offers a peek into the wide world of codes and ciphers, and Emily's hunt through San Francisco features many familiar sites to natives as well as some of the city's rich history.

## _Lalani of the Distant Sea_, Erin Entrada Kelly
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQDwSNYHL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

One blurb I saw about this book described it as "_Moana_ meets _From the Mountain to the Moon_" (see below). I very much agree with the latter -- the beautifully written book features a young girl on a quest that involves stories within stories in a universe of Filipino mythology. The former? I'm not so sure about, other than the fact that at some point Lalani is in a boat and her home island is having a bad spell. Where Moana is the daughter of a village chief, Lalani is a girl in a low social class -- a double whammy in the sexist society where she lives. When her mother falls ill and Lalani feels her own actions have endangered her village, she sets off to find the legendary island of Isa, where riches and happiness flow. But even Isa is not perfect, it turns out. The book leaves some questions dangling, deliberately I think. But you really get to know the characters and cheer their growth. Along the way, Lalani encounters a number of monsters, but manages to persist and ultimately triumph.

## _Jinxed_, Amy McCulloch
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514sS0fghKL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Do your kids like robots? Pets? Intense robot battles? Smartphones? Then this may be the book for them. This "Make: Magazine" bingo card of a book features a brilliant young (half-Chinese?) maker who dreams of being a companioneer -- the people who make _baku_, highly capable robot companions that provide the tech of a near-future smartphone and the comfort of a near-future robot companion -- who comes across a ruined baku and slowly repairs it. But it turns out Jinx isn't like other baku. (I mean, it's in a cat form, so I suppose that's to be expected) He quickly secures a spot for her at her favorite school, and steers many of the events that underlie the book. I worried that this would end up being a "tada, it's actually magic" book, but they do keep Jinx's differences rooted in science fiction, explaining Jinx's behavior as self-writing code and maybe a sentient AI. The baku battles are intense; adult readers may see analogs with dogfighting, while younger readers may find them too much. There's some middle-grade heterosexual romance that doesn't really add to the plot, but there are also open questions about what AIs may begin to ask of themselves.

## _The Girl Who Drank the Moon_, Kelly Barnhill
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MdIF800wL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This book starts out as a gut-wrencher, at least for parents: Officials taking away a new baby from a distraught mother to offer it to the witch in the woods. There is a witch in the woods, but she's somewhat befuddled by why the villagers abandon a kid each year. So she takes the kids and relocates them to other villages, where they often enjoy blessed lives thanks to the starlight the witch feeds them. But one year, she feeds the abandoned child moonlight, which fills her with intense, powerful magic. Xan then decides to raise Luna herself to try and contain her abilities. But once Luna reaches her 13th birthday, the protections begin to fade and some ancient history involving Xan resurfaces in dramatic fashion. This Newbery winner is an intense book. It's theoretically a kids book, but there's a lot going on, and there are definitely dark parts of the story.

## _York: The Shadow Cipher_, Laura Ruby
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gZ3bEX7iL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Oh that we could live in the New York imagined by Ruby in this first book in a series. In her alternate universe set in present day, New York runs on solar power, the Hudson is described as "clear and blue", very sophisticated robots take care of all sorts of menial tasks, and a mysterious puzzle overlays the entire city. All of these advances came thanks to the Morningstarr twins in the late 1800s, but even in this reality, rapacious landlords seek to unhome long-standing residents. When Tess and Theo and their friend Jaime find a clue that suggests there's a _different_ cipher to solve, they set out to find the treasure and save the historic building they're about to be evicted from. There's a recurring theme of how what's important isn't always a big flashy thing but the myriad of normal everyday things that make up a life and a community. While my daughter really enjoyed this leaping puzzle hunt, as an avid puzzle solver I was disappointed to see little in the way of the reality of puzzle-solving. The multiethnic cast of protagonists seems to mostly solve the clues in this parallel cipher by way of intuition and luck, only occasionally going into the mechanics of how a puzzle worked. The fast-paced story doesn't end the way you'd expect, but it does set up a premise for a really interesting second installment.

## _Nevermoor_ series, Jessica Townsend
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51b65ijCx1L._SX342_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I quite like (and my daughter loves) this series about Morrigan Crow, a Caucasian (at least according to the cover) child born on Eventide and thus cursed to die on her eleventh birthday. Instead of dying, though, she's whisked away to a magical place called Nevermoor, where she is entered into a series of trials to enter the Wundrous Society. There are obvious parallels to Harry Potter here -- an eleven-year-old taken from an abusive home to a magical realm, magical buildings and people, a school course load that will make kids envious, and a Chosen One trope -- but the books have their own vibe and the world feels wholly unique, especially by book two, when the author gives us a deeper look at Nevermoor and its many ways. The book gets pretty dark even by book two, but the "bad wizards bad and good wizards good" simplicity of Harry Potter is replaced by a more nuanced view. The Wundrous Society is a magical institution, but it's not hard to catch a fair amount of class resentment against its members. The Big Bad has clearly done bad things and is painted with a menacing brush, but he also helps Morrigan because he needs an ally in a larger fight that we are as yet unaware of.

## _A Tale of Magic_, Chris Colfer
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512aFeVd2UL._SX347_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This first book in a new series is a prequel to the _Land of Stories_ (see below). However, it warrants its own entry because it's clearly a more personal story. Rather than weaving together disparate Western fairy tales, Colfer has to provide the history of his own creation, so he gets to do some world-building independent of canonical fairy tales. Also, it's a fairly heavy-handed metaphor for the way gay people have historically (and, sadly, still) been treated. In his world, magic is something you are born with, and not necessarily along genetic lines. Magic children are beaten and abandoned by their family and their governments. There is even a point later in the book where someone talks about "coming out as magic." Colfer has clearly matured as a writer; this first book feels tighter than the _Land of Stories_ books.

## _Circus Mirandus_, Cassie Beasley
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cplwK0WXL._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Things are not going well for Micah. His grandfather, who took him in after his parents died, is dying, and his grandfather's sister has moved in to tend to him. But she thinks the magical tales Ephraim tells are hogwash. Micah doesn't, and pines to experience the Circus Mirandus himself. His grandfather arranges for a letter to be sent asking the illusionist known as the Lightbender to give him the miracle he's owed. Thus begins a journey in which Micah gets to visit the circus himself, along with his skeptical friend, who can't see the circus until she believes, at least a little, in its magic. There are some solid tropes here, but the story puts a new enough spin on "believing in magic makes it real" that even adults will enjoy it. The story is also fairly deep and sets up nicely for the sequel. The sequel, _The Bootlace Magician_ is a more typical adventure, and it immerses you deeply into the circus's world, but you need to know what's in the first book before reading that one.

## _The Vengekeep Prophecies_, Brian Farrey
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b5FVVbyQL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Jaxter Grimjinx comes from a long line of proud thieves and con men. It's too bad he's not really good at the family trade. But he has a different set of talents that become required to save his town after a family con goes unexpectedly awry. This fast-paced and adventure-packed Hero's Journey, the first in a series, sets up a believable magical world that will keep readers eagerly turning the pages. I appreciate the fact that Jaxter's advantages and abilities to survive his adventures come from studying and knowledge of arcane lore rather than physical skill.

## _The Land of Stories_ series, Chris Colfer
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KXBkHyA7L._SY498_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Tweens Alex and Conner tumble into a book/portal and find themselves in a world populated with the mainstays of Western European fairy tales. Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White have all married brothers from the Charming royal line. Goldilocks is a fugitive after her initial breaking-and-entering crime, Jack from the beanstalk is in love with her, and Red Riding Hood is a democratically elected queen in love with him. In the first book, the twins have to go on a scavenger hunt for iconic storybook items to assemble a spell that will let them get back to their (our) world. There are definitely some more mature things in here that older readers and adult readers may catch that younger readers probably won't -- in the first book, Conner remembers the location of a secret door because it's next to a painting of Red Riding Hood in nothing but a wolf-fur cape, and she is also described as "showing a lot of skin" in a shoulderless gown. I would also note that the population fits the Western Europe origins -- one fairy on the Fairy Council is specifically called Black, so we have to assume the entire rest of the land is Caucasian. A final battle between Red Riding Hood and Goldilocks in book one uses a lot of gendered insults -- harlot and the like. Our daughter and other kids really love this series, and it's become a big franchise for Colfer. Adults will find it enjoyable enough, if also not well-edited.

## _Operation Frog Effect_, Sarah Scheerger
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H44gdOBzL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In this unusually formatted book, the reader gets an over-the-shoulder glance at fifth-grade journals. Typical (and not so typical) middle grade drama plays out not through straight narration but by putting connections together across the journals of eight students. One does hers all in poetry while another does his in screenplays and yet another does his in graphic-novel format. You get a peek into the troubles and triumphs of each student's life (from kids living in a garage to kids living in a mansion, kids going to private school and kids dealing with immigration issues), and the final act will have you cheering for the students' activism.

## _The Magnificent Mya Tibbs: Spirit Week Showdown_, Crystal Allen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mgk9HmH6L._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I've read a lot of best-friend drama -- a staple of fiction aimed at elementary and middle school readers -- at this point, but this was easily one of the most tense of those I've read. The titular Mya Tibbs is a character who stands out from the middle-grade genre: a cowgirl-loving African American who lives in Texas. In this first book in a series, she finds out that her best friend is not so much of a friend and that the school "bully" is a thoughtful, kind person. Even knowing this early on, I was at the edge of my seat as Mya navigated this growth during her school's Spirit Week.

##  _From the Mountain to the Moon_, Grace Lin
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611StlT-2lL._SY346_.jpg)

Inspired by Chinese folklore, this quiet and poetic Caldecott winner features a young girl, Minli, venturing off to see the Old Man in the Moon and ask for her family's fortunes to be changed. Along the way, she encounters a range of characters, including a dragon who becomes a fast friend, who tell their own stories, which seem at first to be unrelated but ultimately all tie together in a rich tapestry that builds Minli's world effectively. By the time she actually gets to the Old Man, she's learned a lot about herself and what's really important in life. Some chapters focus on her parents and their reaction to their daughter's disappearance. There are illustrations in the book, again inspired by Chinese art, but they're sparse enough to keep this book in this list.

## _Eleven Birthdays_, Wendy Mass
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZTOWzWFmL._SY346_.jpg)

Think _Groundhog Day_ for the middle-grade set. Amanda's eleventh birthday is going pretty poorly, which is a shame, since she's about to go through it ten more times. Turns out she and her once-friend Leo are stuck in a loop until they figure out how to get out of it. The actual resolution is hard to see coming, which is unfortunate, but along the way the kids do all the normal stuff you'd expect someone to do if they were stuck in this kind of loop. But over the course of the many birthdays, Amanda and Leo become friends again and become more sure of themselves. This is book one in the loosely connected set of books that make up the _Willow Falls_ stories.

## _The Key to Extraordinary_, Natalie Lloyd
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Km5jIF80L._SX342_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I found this book really moving and thoughtful, with a number of layers, a good mystery, and strong messages about what's important to honor and love. Emma comes from a long line of extraordinary women who call themselves the Wildflowers. At some point, each has a dream that tells her her destiny. When Emma gets hers, she thinks it means one thing, and it does, but not in the way she thinks. The book is infused with magical realism or light fantasy, with magic unusual but also commonplace in this town. Adults may see the twist coming early on, but it doesn't change the intensity of the emotion. Emma has lost her mom before the book begins, and she refers to her feelings as The Big Empty or the hole in her heart. Lots of good thoughts about family and friends in this book set in small-town Tennessee.

## _Pie_, Sarah Weeks
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415G5oermwL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Ipswitch's extraordinarily famous and talented (and economically self-sufficient thanks to inherited wealth) pie maker, Polly, dies without warning and leaves her piecrust recipe to her cat and her cat to her niece Alice, the protagonist. After that, various kid-appropriate hijinks and capers ensue until the mysterious bequest gets figured out. There are some odd scenes in the book -- a teacher whose bodybuilding horrifies her students being the most notable -- and the book adopts a tone that adults might find overly nostalgic for 1950s small-town Americana. Everything is resolved, a bit too neatly, right at the end, though the recipe inheritance has a nice twist. The book ends with a touching epilogue but doesn't really go into how the small town survived a massive hit to its pie-tourism income. Pie recipes (appropriately without recipes for the crust) form chapter divides, which will make you eager to bake by the end. I'll also note that while Polly and Alice prefer vegetable shortening for their crusts, lard is a better candidate in my mind.

## _The Penderwicks_ series, Jeanne Birdsall
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517X2PGEquL._SX338_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This lovely series introduces the Caucasian Penderwick family: four sisters, a dog, and a widower father. The girls range in age from four to twelve in the first book, and the series follows along as they get older. The girls are richly drawn and have complicated relationships with each other, exasperated and loving at the same time. In the first book, they're vacationing in a "cottage" (that allows each family member to have their own bedroom and a study for the dad) that is on the grounds of an estate in the Berkshires. So you can expect fairly middle-class issues. Crushes and first kisses are definitely in play.

## _Nothing But Trouble_, Jacqueline Davies
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bl24qO-cL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I really enjoyed this book about Maggie, a science-and-engineering expert who delights in elaborate MIT-hack-style pranks, and her new arty friend Lena. The book features lots of fun pranks, but also touches heavily on small-town life (both good and bad aspects), dreams that succeed or fail, and getting students engaged with their school. Maggie's dad, an MIT hackster here given credit for the famous "police car on the MIT dome" hack, died before she was born, and all she has left of him are his hacking notebooks and his imagined voice in her head. Over the course of the book, she learns that her sneaky actions have consequences and that maybe she's not quite as anonymous as she's believed.

## _The Library of Ever_, "Zeno Alexander"
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518R66hIo4L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

When Lenora stumbles into a new part of the library, she finds an archway into yet another library, one stunning in its breadth and activity. She's promptly hired and begins a career path that takes some unusual twists and turns. The library is perhaps one of the best fictional libraries ever, featuring massive rooms and halls stuffed with books, subways to take you from one section to another, steampunk conveyances, visitors from all of space and time, and a globe so big it has its own gravity. This unabashed (and maybe a bit heavy-handed) paean to libraries and knowledge starts out with a fairly thin plot that picks up in intensity towards the end.

## _Whatever After_ series, Sarah Mlynowski
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IzrXSUXEL._SX345_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

If you watched the show Super Why, you already have a sense of the plots here. In each book, Abby and her brother Jonah are pulled via magic mirror into a fairy tale (think Grimm, Anderson, and Carroll instead of Disney). They disrupt the normal story, and then have to fix it. Or at least get some things back on track. Our daughter loved the first book but petered out in the second one. Abby self-describes as "bossy" (*cough* internalized misogyny *cough*) and likes things to go according to plan. Her brother? Not so much. She seems fairly invested in making the romance stories continue on track.

## _Harry Potter_ series, J.K. Rowling
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vwh7lDPCL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

You've probably heard of these. But while they're modern classics and required reading for pop culture literacy, it's worth remembering that they're also blatant illustrations of male privilege and patriarchy. Hermione is smart, hard-working, and powerful. But she's the sidekick to an average wizard/jock who is celebrated (and given lots of money) just for showing up. She's called "bossy," a pejorative term almost always used to rebuke smart, confident women who try to take charge. Her social justice movement is written as a source of ridicule and scorn. The person she wants to notice her doesn't see her as a woman until she's given a Cinderella moment on the stairs of a ball, i.e. when she's made herself conventionally attractive and objectifiable. If you subscribe to [Kate Manne's notion of misogyny](https://www.amazon.com/Down-Girl-Misogyny-Kate-Manne/dp/0190604980), you could even argue that the book is misogynist towards Hermione. Every significant leader is a male with female subordinates, and most of the major women fall into easy tropes: warm and motherly (Mrs. Weasley, Lily Potter), strict schoolmistress (Professor McGonigal), ethereal unobtainable beauty (Fleur DeLacouer), or spunky hip girl (Tonks). Also note that Rowling says something fairly cringeworthy once or twice a year, which is inevitable for someone of her celebrity (and because you can't be all things to all people), but she often seems inclined to double down on her statements rather than listen to the community.

## _Castle Glower_ series, Jessica Day George
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ifWX0ssXL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Our daughter devoured this series about a Caucasian girl and her family who live in a magical castle that reshapes itself on a regular basis, usually based on its own thoughts and visions of the future. The book has some intense adventuring, featuring fight scenes and political intrigue. There's a bit of heterosexual crushing and falling in love here and there, the griffins introduced later in the series are sort of a deus ex machina, the book's wizards have fairly patriarchal and patronizing views about women, and it's easy to raise eyebrows at the fact that the Castle never seems to choose a girl as heir to the throne -- what are the protagonist's real options in her future? -- but this is overall a fun series with a girl at the center who's primarily lauded for her intelligence and resourcefulness.

## _The Enchanted Forest Chronicles_, Patricia Wrede
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rUbOGdbxL.jpg)

We picked this book up when our daughter first became interested in books without pictures, and it's a series we've all enjoyed since. Princess Cimorene doesn't like to play by normal princess rules -- she finds princesses who _do_ to be insufferable -- and so she goes to live with a dragon to save herself from princes. She quickly becomes a valued friend to Kazul and they, along with a variety of magical friends, have a wide range of adventures in and around The Enchanted Forest.

## _Bliss_ series, Kathryn Littlewood
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619tb8cFwHL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I swear that "magical parents who don't give their kids proper guidance on magic" is a whole subgenre of middle-school books. While this is certainly in that vein, the tension in the situation is well handled, the magic is interesting, and there is appropriate fix-everything silliness. In the first book, Rose is left in charge of the family bakery, which bakes normal treats but also magical ones, while her parents attend to a crisis in a nearby town. As soon as her parents are gone, mysterious "Aunt" Lily appears and puts the kids under a spell until they eventually surrender the treasured magic cookbook. Many hijinks ensue. There's a bit of girl-on-boy crushing and a whole lot of swooning by townspeople over her older brother's handsomeness (and relatively little space devoted to the fact that he gets to shirk a lot of work because of the handsomeness). I also don't know how I feel about the villainous aunt being a woman with ambition compared to the stay-out-of-the-way ethos of the "good" side of the family.

## _Upside-Down Magic_ series, Sarah Mlynowski, Lauren Myracle, Emily Jenkins
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518m38L9mCL._SX342_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Our daughter devoured this series, falling in love even before she opened the cover with its intensely adorable "dragon kitten" (or dritten.) Nory Horace lives in a world where magic is the norm. But while most people fall easily, predictably, and (one might say) boringly into a few categories with defined skills, Nory is different. Her magic goes "upside-down" or "wonky," much to the embarrassment of her family. She starts attending an Upside-Down Magic class with other kids (notably of very different skin tones; Nory herself is biracial) whose magic doesn't do what it's "supposed" to. It's pretty clear early on that she and her friends represent really powerful magic, as their teacher (an "Upside-Down" person as well) tries to help them control, understand, and use their unique abilities. It's very easy to find parallels to neurodiverse students here, and in the first book there are hints that being different has been squashed in the last century of the world's history.

## _Love Sugar Magic_ series, Anna Meriano
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g01hGEgaL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

We love this series about Leonora Logroño and her family of _bruja_ bakers in small-town Texas. The first book sees Leo learning
about the magic running through the women in her family as they all prepare for Dia de Los Muertos, and then misperforming her own magic to wild effect. There's a bit of sadness, though largely from Leo's friend, whose mom died from cancer before the book started. Mysteries and tense situations are resolved at a good pace, so young readers don't get too anxious or lose any threads. Fortunately, the book ends with recipes, because you'll want to eat something delicious as you read through! (This series will always have a special place; when our daughter switched to independent reading, we had been reading this out loud and she just decided to finish it on her own.)

## _Saving Winslow_, Sharon Breen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41l2%2BQMYJDL._SX348_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In theory, this is a great story for animal lovers: A child in a low-income suburban family nurses a sick donkey to full health until it can return to proper farm life. In practice, I felt like the text had an odd pacing that made it seem dreamlike. Passages of time would go by seemingly randomly. Without a lot of clues, you could be ahead a week or a month. Or maybe the whole book takes place in the span of a few weeks, but with no real context, it's hard to know. The neighbor girl who becomes a friend is given the barest rationale for her peculiar behavior. And, finally, I don't feel like you really get to know the titular donkey very well. Louie's attention to the donkey is a blatant and somewhat heavy-handed counterpoint to the fact that he misses his brother who's in the military.
