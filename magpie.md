I first learned about [Magpie](https://www.piemag.com) years ago. While on the surface it seemed simple enough -- just six puzzles --
I knew that even many members of the [NPL](https://www.puzzlers.org) consider it daunting. The cryptic crosswords in it are notoriously hard.

But as I reached the point where I began to find American cryptics amusing but not particularly challenging, and as I managed to solve a few
_[Listener](https://listenercrossword.com)_ puzzles (also considered very difficult, but about middle of the road for Magpie), I decided to try Magpie.

First of all, these puzzles -- when you can solve them -- never fail to delight, educate, or even amaze. But the difficulty is no lie. For some perspective,
at the moment I normally solve most normal American cryptics (such as the ones in the New York Times or from [Out of Left Field](https://www.leftfieldcryptics.com)) in
around 15-20 minutes. Variety cryptics -- such as those in Harper's or the Wall Street Journal -- can take me 30-40 minutes. It's not unusual for the _easiest_
puzzles in Magpie to take me an hour or more. And as I write this, I've been working on my second-ever D-grade puzzle for three weeks. (The puzzles go up to E.)

While I've gotten better at them through practice, I still struggle to get through them.

And so I decided to strategize specifically in the interest of being able to solve all 6 puzzles in a Magpie issue within the month solvers are given. Here are steps on 
my journey.

## _Chambers_
The _Listener_ puzzles often have a little blurb that says "_[Chambers](https://chambers.co.uk)_ is the primary reference." This is not just a nod to a popular British dictionary; this
is a toned-down indication that you 100% need a copy of the _Chambers_ dictionary. I have the physical version, but the app is invaluable for its ability to do wild-card searches and anagrams.
(Do you think that's cheating? You do you, but you will find the vocabulary in Magpie intense.) The American attitude to cryptic crossword entries is that entries should be relatively
familiar and defensible across a few dictionaries. The British attitude is "this is the reference dictionary and everything in it is fair game." There are so many weird words in
_Chambers_ that I often find myself trying out a word I don't know, and, lo!, it's an entry in _Chambers_. For instance, I was pretty sure that a clue was instructing
me to anagram the letters AOUEUE. I couldn't imagine that was a word, but I tried it in the anagram finder to be sure. Turns out, EUOUAE is an _alternate_ spelling of a medieval musical mnemonic
for Gregorian chants.

That part above where I say "you do you" about looking up stuff? It's still true, but just know what you're up against.

## Start Memorizing

Here are some of the things I've found helpful to memorize:

## British Culture
A challenging aspect of Magpies for Americans is that it often references British culture. Here are things I've learned to help me overcome my cultural gap.
