I first learned about [Magpie](https://www.piemag.com) years ago. While on the surface it seemed simple enough -- just six puzzles --
I knew that even many members of the [NPL](https://www.puzzlers.org) consider it daunting. The cryptic crosswords in it are notoriously hard.

But as I reached the point where I began to find American cryptics amusing but not particularly challenging, and as I managed to solve a few
_[Listener](https://listenercrossword.com)_ puzzles (also considered very difficult, but about middle of the road for Magpie), I decided to try Magpie.

First of all, these puzzles -- when you can solve them -- never fail to delight, educate, or even amaze. Sometimes in the middle of one, I think, "why am I doing this" only to reach a magical point where it all comes together, the puzzle takes on a whole new dimension, and I think "right. that's why." But the difficulty is no lie. For some perspective,
at the moment I normally solve most normal American cryptics (such as the ones in the New York Times or from [Out of Left Field](https://www.leftfieldcryptics.com)) in
around 15-20 minutes. Variety cryptics -- such as those in Harper's or the Wall Street Journal -- can take me 30-40 minutes. It's not unusual for the _easiest_
puzzles in Magpie to take me an hour or more. And as I write this, I've been working on my second-ever D-grade puzzle for three weeks. (The puzzles go up to E.)

While I've gotten better at them through practice, I still struggle to get through them.

And so I decided to strategize specifically with a focus being able to solve all 6 puzzles in a Magpie issue within the month solvers are given. Here are steps on my journey. (Note that much of this advice applies to the _Listener_ puzzle as well.)

## _Chambers_
The _Listener_ puzzles often have a little blurb that says "_[Chambers](https://chambers.co.uk)_ is the primary reference." This is not just "hey, did you know about this dictionary?" this is a toned-down indication that you 100% need a copy of the _Chambers_ dictionary. I have the physical version and the app, but the app is invaluable for its ability to do wild-card searches and anagrams.
(Do you think that's cheating? You do you, but you will find the vocabulary in Magpie intense.) The American attitude to cryptic crossword entries is that entries should be relatively
familiar and defensible across a few dictionaries. Magpie's attitude is "this is the reference dictionary and everything in it is fair game." There are so many weird words in
_Chambers_ that I often find myself trying out a word I don't know, and, lo!, it's an entry in _Chambers_. For instance, I was pretty sure that a clue was instructing
me to anagram the letters AOUEUE. I couldn't imagine that was a word, but I tried it in the anagram finder to be sure. Turns out, EUOUAE is an _alternate_ spelling of a medieval musical mnemonic
for Gregorian chants.

That part above where I say "you do you" about looking up stuff? It's still true, but just know what you're up against. And maybe you knew that mnemonic; how up are you on the local names for flora around the world? Or the many many ... many ... words that are types of fish?

## Start Memorizing
Some of succeeding at Magpie's (or any puzzle with clues, probably) is having a wide array of knowledge you can quickly draw on. Here's a list of things I'm working to memorize. 
[Big Dave's blog](http://bigdave44.com/features/the-mine/) is another (and often overlapping) set.

For the actual practice of memorizing, I'm a big fan of [the method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), a Swiss-army
knife of a technique, as a starting tactic. Nelson Dellis' _[Remember It!](https://www.amazon.com/Remember-People-Passwords-Everything-Forget/dp/1419732560)_ is a decent intro to the topic, though there are a host of similar books that all walk you through the same process, so check your local library. I've also come up with custom strategies for things like Periodic Table symbols, though they're simply tweaks on well-known techniques.

  * Countries
    * Names (often clued as "State" or "Nation")
    * Capitals
    * Current major currency (e.g., dollar) (often clued with slang for money, see below)
    * Current fractional currency  (e.g., cent)
    * Historic currencies
    * International Vehicle Registration codes (often clued as "... /country name/ ... " which corresponds to an IVR code used in the entry)
  * Periodic Table
    * Names
    * Symbols
  * Constellations (often clued as "stars" or "group of stars")
  * Books of the Bible (often clued as "book," though that could also mean "b"!)
  * Hebrew
    * Letters
    * Months
    * Days of the week
  * Greek letters
  * Old English runes
  * SI units
  * Scots words in _Chambers_
  * "Spenser" words in _Chambers_ : words last used by Spenser in the late 1500's (often clued with "poet's")
  * "Shakespeare" words in _Chambers_ : same as "Spenser" but for William Shakespeare (often clued with "Will" or "bard")
  * U.S. States
    * Name
    * Postal Code
  * The _Chambers Crossword Manual_ list of accepted abbreviations for certain words (usually the word in the clue becomes the abbreviation in the entry)
   * Including all the single-letter abbreviations in _Chambers_
  * Slang for money in _Chambers_
  * Names of fish in _Chambers_
   
## British Culture
A challenging aspect of Magpies for Americans is that it often references British culture. Here are things I'm learning/memorizing to help me overcome my cultural gap.
  * Prime Ministers
  * UK Geography
    * London borough names and (because why not) geography
    * Major islands in United Kingdom and Ireland
      * Outer Hebrides
      * Orkney Islands
      * Inner Hebrides
    * Tube Stations
  * Heraldry terms
  * Cricket [Cricket for Dummies](https://bookshop.org/p/books/cricket-for-dummies/18933410?ean=9781394164769), [What Is a Googly?](https://www.amazon.com/What-Googly-Mysteries-Cricket-Explained-ebook/dp/B09GGXFV6C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ROSP5XYRG1G8&keywords=what%27s+a+googly&qid=1703020209&sprefix=what%27s+a+googly%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1)
  * [British monarchs](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/KingsQueensofBritain/)
  * Random:
    * [British menswear ](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-british-menswear-brands/?utm_source=pocket_saves)

## Other
These are other key strategies I'm using that don't fit into the other categories.
