I first learned about [Magpie](https://www.piemag.com) years ago. While on the surface it seemed simple enough -- just six puzzles --
I knew that even many members of the [NPL](https://www.puzzlers.org) consider it daunting. The cryptic crosswords in it are notoriously hard.

But as I reached the point where I began to find American cryptics amusing but not particularly challenging, and as I managed to solve a few
_[Listener](https://listenercrossword.com)_ puzzles (also considered very difficult, but about middle of the road for Magpie), I decided to try Magpie.

First of all, these puzzles -- when you can solve them -- never fail to delight, educate, or even amaze. Sometimes in the middle of one, I think, "why am I doing this" only to reach a magical point where it all comes together, the puzzle takes on a whole new dimension, and I think "right. that's why." But the difficulty is no lie. For some perspective,
at the moment I normally solve most normal American cryptics (such as the ones in the New York Times or from [Out of Left Field](https://www.leftfieldcryptics.com)) in
around 15-20 minutes. Variety cryptics -- such as those in Harper's or the Wall Street Journal -- can take me 30-40 minutes. It's not unusual for the _easiest_
puzzles in Magpie to take me an hour or more. And as I write this, I've been working on my second-ever D-grade puzzle for three weeks. (The puzzles go up to E.)

While I've gotten better at them through practice, I still struggle to get through them.

And so I decided to strategize specifically with a focus being able to solve all 6 puzzles in a Magpie issue within the month solvers are given. Here are steps on my journey. (Note that much of this advice applies to the _Listener_ puzzle as well.)

## Why Are These So Hard?
So they're more daunting than most cryptics, but why? Over the time I've done them, here are some of the items I've noticed.

  - The mechanics are hard. These sort of transformations are very common:
    - Clues might have an extra letter
    - Clues might need a letter inserted
    - Clues might have "misprints" that need to be corrected
    - Entries might need to be entered scrambled
    - Some variation of "you don't know where the entries will go for a while"
    - Some sort of encoding/decoding
    - and various others. This is all before you get to the final part of the puzzle, which often involves the solved grid and instructions you've unearthed as you've solved.
   
  - The themes are hard: old TV shows, various songs, transit lines from large cities, history, allusions to books, physics diagrams, and more have all been themes.
    
  - The vocabulary is hard. The general American mindset is that an entry should be defensible across a few dictionaries and relatively common. The Magpie (and Listener) mindset is: this is the dictionary we use, and anything in it is fair game. For example:
    - Lots of words from the Scots dialect
    - Family/genus names for plants around the world
    - Plants that only grow in one area
    - Currencies, both modern and historic
    - Many types of fish
    - Many types of slang for money
    - etc.
      
 -  They're British
    -  As an American, I simply don't have ready access to British culture and common knowledge
    -  For the kind of person who solves Magpies, I think the British educational experience is much broader than the American one.
    -  British cluing is a bit less rigid than American cluing. The "one side is the definition and the other side is the wordplay" can be a bit more loosey-goosey in British clues

## _Chambers_
The _Listener_ puzzles often have a little blurb that says "_[Chambers](https://chambers.co.uk)_ is the primary reference." This is not just "hey, did you know about this dictionary?" this is a toned-down indication that you 100% need a copy of the _Chambers_ dictionary. I have the physical version and the app, but the app is invaluable for its ability to do wild-card searches and anagrams.

## Start Memorizing
Succeeding at Magpies (or any puzzle with clues, probably) is having a wide array of knowledge you can quickly draw on. Here's a list of things I've either memorized or on my list to memorize.
[Big Dave's blog](http://bigdave44.com/features/the-mine/) is another (and often overlapping) set.

For the actual practice of memorizing, I'm a big fan of [the method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), a Swiss-army
knife of a technique, as a starting tactic. Nelson Dellis' _[Remember It!](https://www.amazon.com/Remember-People-Passwords-Everything-Forget/dp/1419732560)_ is a decent intro to the topic, though there are a host of similar books that all walk you through the same process, so check your local library. I've also come up with custom strategies for things like Periodic Table symbols, though they're simply tweaks on well-known techniques.

  * Countries
    * Names (often clued as "State" or "Nation")
    * Capitals
    * Current major currency (e.g., dollar) (often clued with slang for money, see below)
    * Current fractional currency  (e.g., cent)
    * Historic currencies
    * International Vehicle Registration codes (often clued as "... /country name/ ... " which corresponds to an IVR code used in the entry)
  * Periodic Table
    * Names
    * Symbols
  * Constellations (often clued as "stars" or "group of stars")
  * Books of the Bible (often clued as "book," though that could also mean "b"!)
    * (And note that "books" often translates to "ot" or "nt" for Old Testament and New Testament)
  * Hebrew (often just clued as "letter" or "month" or "day," depending)
    * Letters
    * Months
    * Days of the week
  * Greek letters
  * Old English runes
  * SI units
  * Scots words in _Chambers_
  * "Spenser" words in _Chambers_ : words last used by Spenser in the late 1500's (often clued with "poet's")
  * "Shakespeare" words in _Chambers_ : same as "Spenser" but for William Shakespeare (often clued with "Will" or "bard")
  * U.S. States
    * Name
    * Postal Code
  * The _Chambers Crossword Manual_ list of accepted abbreviations for certain words (usually the word in the clue becomes the abbreviation in the entry)
   * Including all the single-letter abbreviations in _Chambers_
  * Slang for money in _Chambers_
  * Names of fish in _Chambers_
   
## British Culture
A challenging aspect of Magpies for Americans is that it often references British culture. Here are things I'm learning/memorizing to help me overcome my cultural gap.
  * [Prime Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom)
  * UK Geography
    * London borough names and (because why not) geography
    * Major islands in United Kingdom and Ireland
      * Outer Hebrides
      * Orkney Islands
      * Inner Hebrides
    * Tube Stations
    * [The Roman names for British cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cities_in_Britain)
  * Heraldry terms
  * Cricket [Cricket for Dummies](https://bookshop.org/p/books/cricket-for-dummies/18933410?ean=9781394164769), [What Is a Googly?](https://www.amazon.com/What-Googly-Mysteries-Cricket-Explained-ebook/dp/B09GGXFV6C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ROSP5XYRG1G8&keywords=what%27s+a+googly&qid=1703020209&sprefix=what%27s+a+googly%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1)
  * [British monarchs](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/KingsQueensofBritain/)
  * Random:
    * [British menswear ](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-british-menswear-brands/?utm_source=pocket_saves)

## Other
These are other key strategies I'm using that don't fit into the other categories.
  * Upon getting the solutions to an issue, look through each clue and explanation of the solution to learn phrasings, new word fragments, and more.
