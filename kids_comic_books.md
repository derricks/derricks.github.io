## The Books We've Read
### _Owly_ series, Andy Runton
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-7MRDuHiL._SX348_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Mostly wordless comic books featuring the gentle adventures of an owl and its worm friend. While Owly and Wormy talk occasionally, they do so with pictograms. Note that since nothing says Owly is a boy, you can read it with the protagonists being girls. Artwork is straightforward but evocative.

### _Korgi_ series, Christian Slade
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eSBn5rFiL.jpg)

A series by someone who clearly enjoys drawing detailed fairies and corgis in pencil. Adventures of a Caucasian pixie girl (a "molly") who has a magical corgi. Which is about as adorable as you can imagine. The wordless (minus the intros) stories can be quite scary, so you might have to edit for younger audiences.

### _Sketch Monsters_ series, Joshua Williamson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Lri1VzbyL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In this simple series, kids who doodle monsters to hide their true selves have to deal with the consequences when those doodles escape the sketchbooks. Simple messages about being true to oneself are carried by simple artwork.

### _Peter & Ernesto_ series, Graham Annable
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zSeMMsb9L._SX390_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Because who doesn't love sloths? And maybe the notion that sloths are lazy is incorrect. Maybe they're just content. Thus the tone is set for Ernesto, who wants to see and do new things, and his friend Peter, who is, well, content. The personalities of the two sloths, and the choice of language and sentence structure reminds me quite a bit of the Elephant & Piggie books. The stories are appropriately silly.

### Kevin McCloskey comics (_We Dig Worms_, _The Real Poop on Pigeons_, etc.)
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519hNMUrZ3L._SY331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

These books, published by Toon Books, are science-based comics for the younger reader. They pack a lot of information into a relatively small amount of fun text. Kids love facts, and these are good reads for them

### _Chi's Sweet Home_ series, Kanata Konami
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515yRCdp2wL._SX373_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

If you have cats, you'll particularly appreciate this manga about a kitten who moves in with a Japanese family (despite a no-pets rule in their apartment) and has adventures around the neighborhood with other cats and dogs. Konami perfectly captures the mindset of a cat and the humans who see it. Warning, if you read it aloud to your kids, you'll be reading a lot of sound effects.

### _CatStronauts_ series, Drew Brockington
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CW6wechNL._SX338_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I mean, it's called _CatStronauts_ and the primary characters are Waffles, Pom-Pom, Blanket, and Major Meowster. So you kind of know what you're signing up for, don't you? The adventures remind me of the Rocky and Bullwinkle genre, wherein something tremendous is at stake and the heroes are the ones to execute a somewhat bonkers plan to solve the problem. That said, Brockington loves space and adds a veneer of truthfulness to the stories: In the first one, for example, the cats need to build a space-based solar power station to transmit energy to the earth on microwaves -- a real concept -- and when the rocket launches, there's an extended sequence in which all the cats in Mission Control give their go/no go signals. But, in the end, it's cats being silly space travelers.

### _Dog Man_ series, Dav Pilkey
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gTd0Bq83L._SY346_.jpg)

The conceit here is that two kids are revisiting the Dog Man (and Captain Underpants, which is also from the same real-world author) comic books they wrote as first-graders, and that's pretty much how the books read. Expect potty humor, simple jokes, and outlandish behavior. These are books that kids can talk about with each other and that adults will roll their eyes about.

### _Yotsuba&!_, Kiyohiko Azuma
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JqkW3-qFL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This popular manga features the adventures of an energetic and curious five-year-old after she and her adoptive father move to a new house. She quickly befriends the neighbor girls and has a variety of cuckoo (but age-appropriate) adventures with plenty of slapstick and misunderstandings. American parents might be surprised by the independence she's given, and will definitely notice adult topics such as her dad's friend accusing the dad of sleeping with one of the underage neighbor girls (he was't), but our daughter enjoyed the silly antics of a younger child.

### _Hilda_ series, Luke Pearson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AUfTQ3gmL._SX358_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

One of our favorite series. The adventures of a Caucasian blue-haired girl who lives in a vaguely Nordic area and has lots of adventures with the fantastic creatures she meets there. Hilda is a great character, not just because she's a clever, adventuring girl, but also because she feels real. She rolls her eyes at her mum's attention, has realistic reactions to friends, and so on. But she's a fundamentally good kid. Midnight Giant is my favorite of the series for its parallel structure, but our daughter's favorite is The Black Hound. There's a Netflix series about her as well, though it departs fairly strongly from the books.

### _Drew and Jot_, Art Baltazar
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bKTT25NsL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Drawings escaping from a child's notebook and into the real world is a popular idea with authors who write for children: Just in this list there's _Sketch Monsters_ (above) and _Doodleville_ (below). This brightly colored, boldly drawn book sees two boys who both love to draw swapping ideas for their two favorite characters, whose adventures play out as pages in this book with occasional peeks back into our world. And then Andrew's young sister gets in on the fun, and things go really bonkers. A cuckoo plot with lots of action makes this a quick, enjoyable read.

### _Cucumber Quest_ series, Gigi D.G.
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518YLC+cr+L.jpg)

This zany and far-reaching fantasy series features an ensemble cast, dubious motivations, and witty dialog. Parents will see a lot of extra jokes, but kids will enjoy it, too. The book starts with a "chosen one" rabbit creature who doesn't really want to be chosen, while his sister is all about the fighting. At one point, she deliberately helps the villains in the piece so that she'll have something to fight. The two collect extra friends as they wander the kingdom to power the sword that will defeat the gigantic Nightmare Knight. At least for a bit. This also exists as a webcomic if you want to read it that way.

### _Once Upon a Space-Time_, Jeffrey Brown
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+--qZs-PL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This graphic novel reads more like a narrative arc told through comic strips, and is a good step up for those who liked _Catstronauts_ (see above) but maybe aren't quite ready for _Sanity and Tallulah_ (see below). When humanity makes first contact with a prank-loving alien named Tobey (who is in fact merely one of the many Tobey clones, all called Tobey), elite astronauts are excited to venture into space with the high-tech systems Tobey has shared with us. Instead, two human children are chosen -- it's not really clear why -- and venture off to Mars, where they meet other aliens and stumble through a series of mild adventures. Lots of kid-friendly humor mixes with reasonable science and facts to create a somewhat absurd story that is sure to keep kids laughing.

### _Princess Princess Ever After_, Katie O'Neill
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cwUO0Si3L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

A decidedly feminist take on the standard fairy tale, this quick read features a woman of color rescuing a Caucasian princess in a tower. Said princess has been locked there by her older sister, who doesn't want competition for the throne and who denigrates her younger sibling by calling her fat and stupid. There's a fair amount of "not nice" language, like the aforementioned "fat" and "stupid" and a prince the women nickname Butthead. The two princesses end up by getting married.

### _Sea Sirens: A Trot and Cap'n Bill Adventure_, Amy Chu & Janet Lee
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51q3WC6CD1L._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This richly drawn comic (whose style evokes _Fish Girl_ below) features Trot, a Vietnamese-American surfer, and her cat Cap'n Bill as the two discover the underwater queendom of the sea sirens and their mortal enemies the Serpents. The tale draws inspiration from a number of sources, including Vietnamese folklore, and follows a number of tropes along the way. Still, there's a surprise twist in store for the reader. Note that her grandfather suffers from dementia, and the plot is often driven by his confused lapses.

### _The Cardboard Kingdom_, Chad Sell (and others)
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J47VzqXdL._SX339_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

There's a lot going on in these pages, which is largely about a group of kids having intense imaginary play, fueled by discarded cardboard. The artwork goes back and forth between how an adult might see the kids -- boxes on heads and chunky cardboard accessories -- and how they see themselves -- heavily stylized with flowing robes and glowing armor. There are kids with family issues, kids of color and different sexual orientation, kids with big imaginations, and kids with more analytic streaks. The stories in the book tie together, but largely focus on particular characters for their arc.

### _Doodleville_, Chad Shell
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQdlvC5HL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In Drew's world, the term "dynamic art" takes on a whole new meaning. Drawings and paintings aren't confined to the page they're on. But Drew's Doodles don't behave themselves the way other kids' characters do, and this puts Drew at odds with her classmates as she tries to wrangle her boisterous art. When a museum trip inspires her to draw a leviathan, she accidentally infuses it with her own self-doubt and anxiety, and it becomes a fearsome monster that wreaks havoc on her friends' sketchbooks. Between this and _The Cardboard Kingdom_ (see above), I'd happily just buy anything Chad Sell produces. This world is imaginative and allows him to tell a story about feelings and friends that is reminiscent of _Sketch Monsters_ (also see above) but for a somewhat older crowd.

### _Hilo_ series, Judd Winick
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51icAe7ndrL.jpg)

A burping robot boy who can fly and shoot lasers from his hands is the titular boy, which will no doubt appeal to many children. But beyond the lowbrow humor, there's a lot of depth in these books; even in the
first book, it's hinted that Hilo is both the solution and the cause of the problems facing Earth, and that the "bad guy" maybe has the right message but the wrong implementation. One could maybe raise an eyebrow
about a basically Aryan kid come to save the sidekicks who are people of color, but the girl in that set is also a super nerd.

### _Star Scouts_, Mike Lawrence
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Sgi9wW-qL._SX351_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Avanti is having a hard time fitting in to her new school in this first book of a fun trilogy. Her father has her join the local Flower Scouts to meet new friends, but she finds the members boring (though sharp readers will notice one who stands out long before it becomes obvious at the end). Then she's abducted by another Scout: an alien who was trying to collect a newt for a Star Scout badge. She missed her target ... which ... turns out to be not atypical with her efforts. Avanti then finds herself in a science fiction universe, and teleports back and forth to that each day when her dad thinks she's at Flower Scouts. She ultimately gets a chance to go to sleepaway camp with her alien troop, and enters a competition with a rival troop that will determine if humans should be allowed in to Star Scouts at all. There's kid-friendly gross-out humor, jetpack races, middle-grade friend drama, and a host of escapades.

### _Phoebe and Her Unicorn_ series, Dana Simpson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hu6SdkyoL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This series is pretty witty, but note that a lot of the humor relies on sarcasm and the common experiences of grade school kids. The series features a Caucasian girl who befriends an astonishingly vain unicorn. It's often compared to Calvin and Hobbes (sadly, as in "Calvin and Hobbes for girls" as if girls can't appreciate Calvin and Hobbes or boys can't appreciate _Phoebe and Her Unicorn_), probably because the unicorn often has wry observations of humanity and Phoebe is a bit of an outsider at school. This is a series my daughter returns to again and again.

### _Babymouse_ series, Jennifer & Matthew Holm
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dLjAdHS5L.jpg)

Lots of kids love this series about a mouse going through school and having typical schoolkid adventures (jealous of friends, wants to be popular, etc.). We found it fairly dreary and stopped reading after a couple books.

### _Pets on the Loose!_ series, Victoria Jamieson
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51w32nn69nL.jpg)

What happens when well-known rodent criminals get turned into school pets? Well, they go a bit soft. Their priorities change. And suddenly they're battling their equivalents from the older kids' classrooms. Goofy plots and elaborate capers make for an enjoyable, light read

### _Misadventures of Salem Hyde_ series, Frank Cammuso
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TQohdX-1L._SX360_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Salem Hyde is a witch living in a non-magic world. Frank Cammuso's sight gags and wordplay are on fine display here as Salem has a variety of misadventures of the magical kind. Fun and giggle-inducing.

### _Magic Trixie_ series, Jill Thompson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wc3wIMpfL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This story would be about normal childhood emotions -- jealousy about siblings, being dissatisfied with one's own life, wanting to do things you're not allowed to do -- except the Caucasian protagonist and her family are all witches of various forms. And her friends include vampires, werewolves, and mummies. Rich graphics provide lots of detail to enjoy, and there are in-jokes for the parents as well.

### _Edison Beaker_ series, Frank Cammuso
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UVuyGPlpL._SX350_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Edison Beaker, who loses his dad at the beginning of the first book, is afraid of the dark. But he wards it off with the flashlight his dad gave him before disappearing. When he and his sister Tesla are left with their uncle for a time, they discover that the family business of "pest extermination" is really more of a Ghostbusters enterprise, and he and his sister get swept up into a quest to deal with the denizens of The Underwhere (much snickering here). The action is fast-paced, and some of the scenes might be scary for younger readers, but overall this is a light adventure with goofy evil henchmen, an escape artist hamster, and some sort of warrior elf girl who teams up with Edison. All the human characters are Caucasian.

### _Bera the One Headed Troll_, Eric Orchard
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510el3cP9-L._SX389_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Bera, a pumpkin farmer in the land of trolls, rescues a human baby from evil mermaids and sets off to return it to a human village. She tries to find help from troll heroes and other assorted magical creatures while staying a step ahead of a witch who wants to cook the baby, but ultimately has to solve the problems herself. The artwork in this fairy tale, done in browns and oranges, evokes _The Nightmare Before Christmas_, but is its own unique style.

### _Pilu of the Woods_, Mai Nguyen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516wpTgAj3L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Willow is feeling pretty depressed about her mother's recent death, and the school bullies aren't helping. She retreats to the nearby woods, a place she visits often with her dad. She meets Pilu, a wood spirit, who has run away from her mother and sisters. Willow helps her find her way back, but on the way the girls have to deal with Willow's emotions as they come to life. The feelings are represented as green monsters trapped in bottles. Each girl teaches the other a lesson that helps her appreciate her own life. A more somber take on feelings-as-monsters than _Sketch Monsters_.

### _Diana: Princess of the Amazons_, Shannon Hale & Dean Hale
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51E3FWW3BiL.jpg)

Yes, _that_ Diana. This is a cute, lower-middle grade entrypoint for Wonder Woman, written by the Hales -- most known in our household for _The Princess in Black_. In this story, Diana bemoans being the only child on an island full of adults who are immortal and the best at everything they do. Especially when her mom has less and less time for her. So, remembering her own origin story, she seemingly creates a friend for herself out of clay and sand. The friend isn't what she seems, but before we find that out, we see her tempting Diana into mischief and troublemaking against her Paradise Island neighbors. There are some nods to the larger Wonder Woman universe, but you needn't know anything about that character to enjoy this story.

### _Zatanna and the House of Secrets_, Matthew Cody
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BrAQesG6L._SX342_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Much like _Diana: Princess of the Amazons_, _Zatanna and the House of Secrets_ tells a story of the teenage years of a DC superheroine, though this one somewhat less well known than Wonder Woman. I don't know much about Zatanna the character, but this is a fun story in which she learns that not only is her dad not simply a stage magician, but that she too is a real magician who can make things happen by saying words backwards. And her house is named The House of Secrets, full of mysterious magic. And the family's pet rabbit can talk. Big day! In this adventure, she has to stop The Witch Queen from taking over the House and rescue her dad. As with _Diana_, I'm sure there are allusions to Zatanna's more adult storylines, but you certainly don't need to know them to enjoy the story.

### _Aquicorn Cove_, Katie O'Neill
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S2bI7XFaL.jpg)

This sweet and simple story features young Lana visiting her Aunt Mae at the seaside town where Lana and her family lived before her mom -- Mae's sister -- died at sea. While there, she takes care of a small not-quite-seahorse (the titular aquicorn) and learns that her aunt once met an undersea resident but ignored her pleas to take better care of the ocean, saying there wasn't anything the small village could do in the face of such destruction. By the end, the land dwellers have come around to taking care of the ocean better, even in small ways. Aunt Mae is a a muscular, dark-skinned woman (Lana is drawn as lighter-skinned, as is her mother), and some readers might read her friendship with the underwater woman as romantic, but that's only hinted at in the text.

### _Bone_ series, Jeff Smith
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K2-fwKmYL.jpg)

Ask a dozen current, middle-ageish comics artists for inspirations, and _Bone_ is likely to come up a few times. But I personally found it kind of meh. My daughter loved the antics of the blob-headed Bones, from everyman Fone Bone to conniving Phoney Bone to dim-witted Smiley Bone, but I found it tough to care about any of the characters or their plights, and all the characters seemed like exaggerated types. That said, the story takes a number of twists and turns and is fairly epic in nature, so it has a lot going for it. Note that many of the characters smoke.

### _Amulet_ series, Kazu Kibuishi
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-FQ6P5WBL.jpg)

Google "graphic novels for kids" and this series is certain to show up early and often. We know at least one family who credits this popular series with getting their kid to read, and it's not hard to see why. It's an intense epic fantasy that takes place in a surreal, vividly imagined world. The Caucasian female protagonist finds a magic stone her great-grandfather left in his house, and she enters the realm where he disappeared to. His homemade robots become both servants and allies as she battles against the malicious elves and sinister forces at work among the other Stonekeepers. I particularly like that the stone isn't just default good. It shapes itself to its wielder's desires and heart, even as it tries to tempt the wielder to take -- or perhaps relinquish -- control.

### _Pashmina_, Nidhi Chanani
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZmyoRFS2L.jpg)

Indian-American protagonist Priyana has lots of questions about India, her father, and her mother's life before her. Questions her mom simply doesn't want to answer. But Priyana finds a magic-infused pashmina that gives her a glimpse of that other world and furthers her desire to go to India. The pending birth of a niece gives her an excuse, and together she and her aunt track down the history of the pashmina. In some ways, this book feels like a disjointed narrative that exists to tell the story of a factory fire that killed a number of women in India. Older readers and certainly adults will see a lot of sexism in the male attitudes towards women.

### _Cici's Journal_ series, Joris Chamblain & Aurélie Neyret
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JI2YIz4iL._SX363_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This beautifully drawn series has rich, deep storylines set in the real world. Cici is a would-be writer who finds interesting mysteries around her and works with her friends to get to the root of them. Cici is Caucasian, as are most of the people around her (the books are imported from France or Belgium)

### _Island Book_, Evan Dahm
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418jwie0fNL._SY498_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This story features a young alien woman who sets out to learn about a monster that seems drawn to her. She sets out from her island on to a sea that her people have always said is empty of all but the monster, but quickly discovers that there are a number of islands out there, each with their own unique species and stories. The story leaves some ends dangling, but there's a #1 on the spine, so presumably later stories will explore the world more.

### _Zita the Space Girl_ series, Ben Hatke
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kVa6wvJIL.jpg)

Look up "comics books for girls" and Zita is likely to be near the top of the list. We're big Ben Hatke fans, largely because of this sci-fi adventure. Zita and a friend (a boy, both Caucasian) get sucked into a spacefaring civilization and have to make their way back home. Colorful characters in an ensemble cast support the friends as they navigate the new worlds. We read it to our daughter when she was quite young, but she recently re-read it herself by doing one book a night.

### _Mighty Jack_ series, Ben Hatke
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BvqlFxW-L._SX354_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

There are some intersection points with the Zita series (read that series first to get the jokes) but this is a standalone fantasy series that focuses on a Caucasian boy, his autistic sister, and a fierce Caucasian friend (girl) who lives down the street. The three plant a garden with out-of-this-world (literally) seeds that create a range of adventures.

### _Chasma Knights_, Boya Sun & Kate Reed Petty
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Yp0e4LfSL._SX390_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This book (maybe first in a series) drops you right into a vividly colored surreal world in which "knights" named for chemical elements bond with "toys" to make incredible devices and experiences. Except for the main character, who, as a neon knight, can't fuse with toys. Instead, she figures out how to make new and more interesting toys by scavenging parts from others. Looks like standard kid themes of isolation, finding a small number of good friends over being popular, and wanting to show up those who teased you. There's also an undercurrent of how destructive capitalism can be.

### _The City on the Other Side_, Mairghread Scott
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VltbpuLOL.jpg)

What if the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were _actually_ caused by a massive war in the land of fairies, which occupies our same geography but on the other side of a mystical veil? This is the situation Latina protagonist Isabel finds herself in when she accidentally crosses the veil and sets out on a quest to rescue the Seelie Fairy Queen from a mystical prison. She's chased and aided by a host of fairies as well as a Filipino boy who survived the quake. There are lovely visual details in the rich spreads, and the back matter talks about SF's history and the artistic inspirations for the characters.

### _The Okay Witch_, Emma Steinkellner
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WyWzckXaL.jpg)

Moth Hush is living a normal life as a put-upon middle-schooler in Founder's Bluff, MA, when she discovers that she's actually a witch. And her mom is a witch, too, who was in fact born in the late 1600s. But the witches around Founder's Bluff were chased out for spurious reasons by the ancestors of the still-prominent Kramer family, and the witches retreated to a mystical realm outside of time and space. Moth uses her mom's journal to see the past of the town and her family, despite her mom's reluctance to talk about, and especially teach, witchcraft. It's not hard to see Moth's blossoming magic as a stand-in for puberty, and it's easy to see how the Kramers have really been more about oppressing women and women of color than protecting their town. It's also easy to see a "who writes the history books" theme as Moth learns the reality of historic events. Still, the author ends on a hopeful note as the town's mayor promises to be better and Moth's mother and grandmother begin to reconcile their painful estrangement.

### _W.I.T.C.H._ series, Elisabetta Gnone
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ml9xA-GSL.jpg)

You could be forgiven for thinking that this is an English-language translation of a typical Japanese magical girl manga (complete with silly superhero costumes and willowy bodies), but in fact it originated in Italy. The multivolume saga tells the story of five ordinary teenage girls gifted with wide-ranging magical powers so that they can act as Guardians of the Veil, who are supposed to protect a dimensional bridge between Earth and the kingdom of Metamoor. Or something like that. There is definitely some kissing and crushing, but nothing gets too serious.

### _Sanity and Tallulah_, Molly Brooks
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mlpzqr2mL._SX344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This large sci-fi volume focuses on two girls who live on a giant space station. Like any other tweenage girls, they go beyond the rules sometimes. In Sanity's case, that means creating a three-headed kitten -- Princess, Sparkle, Destroyer of Worlds -- in the station's bio labs. Subplots around Tallulah's father hint at stories that don't make it into the first volume, but the main story is about the space station going on the fritz due to some sort of invasive pest -- who shows up right when Princess, Sparkle, Destroyer of Worlds goes missing. The artwork shows off the diverse residents of the station as well as the many interiors.

### _Fish Girl_, Donna Jo Napoli & David Wiesner
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617gUXOVs2L._SX360_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

A Caucasian mermaid lives in a water-filled house and gradually learns that she's being held from her true home by the sideshow entertainer who plays the part of Neptune in his shows. She slowly figures out how to get free. This is a bittersweet story, and there are some parts that parents will read as leering boys harassing a pretty girl, but it's filled with Wiesner's rich artwork and touches on themes of friendship, loss, and home.

### _Clan Apis_, Jay Hosler
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sl%2BguGaWL._SX346_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Think science comics won't move you? This is a book that imparts a huge amount of information about the science of bees in a good narrative. The story focuses on a single drone's life, but her eager questions about the world around her drive a lot of science in with the plot. The end is moving -- bees don't have a long life -- and there is loss and victory throughout.

### _Secret Coders_ series, Gene Luen Yang
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nHgYP2LGL._SX353_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I don't know what about this series clicked with my daughter, but she absorbed this series eagerly. Three kids, a Caucasian girl named Gracie Hopper, an African-American boy named Eni, and an Asian-American boy named Josh use Logo to save the world. No, really. Some well-known real-world references (Seymour Papert, Flatland), but otherwise a complicated science fiction plot. Many pages in each book are devoted to stepping through increasingly complex Logo problems.

### _The Tea Dragon Society_, Katie O'Neill
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510f0H%2B%2BcSL._SX362_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)
A gentle fantasy story about Greta, who discovers the almost-lost art of raising tea dragons, small animals who grow tea leaves that impart visions when steeped. A loving gay relationship and multiracial characters make for a diverse cast, but the joy is really in the appreciation of artisanal products.

### _Jellaby_ series, Kean Soo
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R08yfAatL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This two-book series, in which the two protagonists work to restore a purple monster to its home, has some very frightening aspects, but ultimately follows a heroic arc. A fair amount of the book takes place in the nightmares of the Caucasian girl at the center of the book.

### _Brave Chef Brianna_, Sam Sykes & Selina Espiritu
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sqcqEBSnL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Brianna's father is a world-famous chef, and he challenges his kids to set up their own shops and compete for the right to use his branding going forward. Brianna sets herself up as a restaurateur in a city mostly populated by "monsters." There are clear notes about prejudice and tolerance and feeling good about one's self and believing in something here. Brianna (Caucasian, like her siblings) is full of self-doubt, and uses lots of mean words to describe herself, but ultimately triumphs -- if not in the way readers anticipate.

### _Sunny Side Up_, Jennifer L. Holm
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512cdrp6rcL.jpg)

This is a pretty light book when you consider that drug addiction is a prominent theme. When we first meet Caucasian Sunny, she's been sent to spend the summer of 1976 with her grandfather in a retirement community in Florida. She soon meets another kid, the groundskeeper's child, and the two have standard summer idyll adventures: reading comics, collecting golf balls, scrabbling for money, and so on. But periodic flashbacks tell the reader how she ended up there -- her parents are trying to help her drug-addicted brother, and they want her clear of what will certainly be a hard journey for him. The tension of keeping secrets finally causes her to explode, which in turn lets her grandfather give her some words of advice. An author's note addresses readers frankly about dealing with an addicted family member.

### _Abigail and the Snowman_, Roger Langridge
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gev37IuZL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Abigail (possibly Caucasian, possibly of color -- the shading makes it hard to tell) befriends a yeti who has escaped some sort of secret government lab. There's violence here (helicopters being shot down) along with a frightening moment where it seems like the yeti has died, but it all works out on the end.

### _The Courageous Princess_, Rod Espinosa
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jTN67lubL.jpg)

When Princess Mabelrose gets kidnapped by a dragon and taken far from home, she decides to effect her own escape rather than waiting for a prince or a ransom. With courage, kindness, and some fortuitous treasures from the dragon's lair, she makes her way across the sprawling continent where she lives, helping those she meets even as her father moves southward to begin his own rescue. This sprawling, imaginative, lushly drawn, multiethnic fantasy (though Mabelrose is drawn as Caucasian) is full of allusions to other fairy tales and stories. A bit too much time is spent on noting that Mabelrose isn't your standard princess-pretty (though she's actually drawn as quite attractive), but no one denies her bravery and courage. The first book in particular also devotes a lot of time to her and her family praying, which is not common in the comics we typically read.

### _Four Points_ series, Hope Larson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ekw7vjmSL._SX335_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

If Robert Louis Stevenson wrote graphic novels, there's a good chance they'd look like this fast-paced adventure. Orphans, buried treasure, traps, twists, vengeance, and more keep this mid-19th-century tale going at a fast clip. Alex and Cleo, redheaded Caucasian twins who are (they think) newly orphaned, are on the run from a pirate gang whose captain is intent on retrieving the knife and watch they carry. The two items together reveal coordinates to the treasure stash hoarded by their real parents, who were themselves pirates. Cleo pushes back against the sexist norms of her day, though she doesn't make us much traction as one would like.

### _The Nameless City_ series, Faith Erin Hicks
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615ZQQ5zRFL._SX351_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This rich, action-filled story of politics and war is set in a city that has been conquered so many times the long-term residents simply call it "The Nameless City." Thirty years ago, the Dao "brought peace" to the city by conquering it yet again. Into this comes a teenager from the Dao empire, the son of a powerful Dao chief and a Dao general. He shortly meets and befriends a city girl who calls herself Rat, and the two work together to help convert the city into one ruled by a council of nations. Rat teaches Kai her parkour-esque running style, which the two use to bring about the change that promises to bring real peace to the city. Hicks based her artwork and ideas on 13th-Century China and does a powerful job of crafting a world where city residents are resigned to waves of oppression while also resenting them.

### _The Dam Keeper_ series, Robert Kondo
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5173M+RbWIL.jpg)

Young protagonist Pig (who is in fact a pig) is the dam keeper of Sunrise Valley, a job he inherited after his father disappeared into the dark mist that covers the world and that the dam holds at bay. After Pig (and his friends Fox and Hippo -- one wonders what their parents are named) notices that the dark mist is retreating and pounding against the dam in a new pattern, his dam is damaged and he has to go into the world outside the town's borders. Along the way, he encounters other outposts of light populated by muppet-like animals, kept safe by their own dams, and begins to understand why the dark is behaving the way it is. The lovely artwork in this could be tough to follow for younger readers, as it often resembles something between a storyboard and a more typical graphic novel (perhaps not coincidentally: it was also [a short film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Keeper))

### _Lumberjanes_ series, Shannon Watters and Grace Ellis
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hyzbHVsFL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

An enthusiastically feminist comic series starring five girls attending a summer camp where not-of-this-world creatures are common visitors to the surrounding woods. Interesting plots, and nothing but strong female characters. Even within the main five girls, there's race and class diversity, one trans girl, and one lesbian relationship. The girls "swear" by naming feminist icons. Think, "Holy Clara Booth Luce!"

### _Goldie Vance_ series, Hope Larson
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eR20Po1fL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

In theory, Marigold "Goldie" Vance works as a valet at the lush Crossed Palms resort in Florida where her dad is the manager. But she _actually_ dreams of being a detective, and manages to embroil herself and her fellow hotel staff in a wide range of crime-solving activities. Goldie's got a lot of spunk, and only hesitates briefly when she needs to, for instance, "borrow" a car to help her solve a case. While Larson's cast is diverse, it doesn't necessarily reflect the 1960s Florida it's so clearly set in. An African-American acting as hotel manager? His biracial daughter from a mixed marriage? A potential queer relationship? Maybe it's actually set in a parallel universe where bigotry was nowhere to be seen. Anyway, the mysteries are solid and take a range of twists and turns along the way. The collected volumes also have back matter that shows you how a few of the pages were developed by the creators.

### _Roller Girl_, Victoria Jamieson
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515Ily7DHCL.jpg)

This Newbery medal winner is full of all the middle-grade feelings. Feeling like you don't belong. Feeling big emotions. Feeling like your best friend is no longer your friend. Feeling nervous about middle school. Feeling the need to make an identity for yourself. And all set in a girl's burgeoning love of roller derby. My daughter was 6.5 when she read this, and I imagine some of the tween angst went over her head, but she was bouncing and cheering during the final roller derby bout all the same. The protagonist and her closest friends are all Caucasian.

### _Cleopatra in Space_ series, Mike Maihack
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51e-7B0rIdL.jpg)

This sprawling sci-fi Egypt-themed adventure reminds me a lot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer for some reason. Cleopatra -- _the_ Cleopatra -- is a super-strong fighter, but relies on a group of friends to actually beat the ubiquitous Big Bad. There's a fair amount of middle grade/high school romantic feelings about, but overall this is a good romp with lots of action and political maneuvering.

### _Diesel: Ignition_ Tyson Hesse
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lNwrMU7DL.jpg)

It's hard to sympathize with Dee Diesel, the Caucasian protagonist of this sci-fi adventure set in a post-apocalyptic, post-war world. The book starts with her lording her imminent ownership of floating city Peacetowne over everyone she can. Her refusal to listen and consider others leads directly to the city being shot down, resulting in the deaths of half the population. But in the end, she puts herself at risk in order to help a city full of people under attack by their old enemies. Enemies who used to be flying bird people but lost the ability to fly when Dee's adoptive father bioengineered a mutation that grounded them. Dee and one of her other adopted siblings have an ability to generate sparks of power with a snap of their fingers, but we never find out why that's the case. This was clearly intended to be a setup for a larger story, but as far as I know the rest of the story wasn't developed.

### _Princeless_ series, Jeremy Whitley
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51V8MgD0aHL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

If _Lumberjanes_ isn't feminist enough for you, be sure to check out this series in which princess Adrienne (who is Black) effects her own rescue from the tower her sexist, misogynist father put her into. After convincing her guardian dragon to side with her and befriending a woman dwarf blacksmith, the princess sets off to rescue her sisters and others she finds locked up. Her brother, meanwhile, is a disappointment to their father because he wants to go into theater. The first book features an amusing look at "traditional" armor for women that might require an explanation if your child hasn't seen the typical ludicrous bikini armor of male-gaze artwork.

### _Mouse Guard_ series, David Petersen
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6106OZNZzUL._SY498_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This complex adventure features mice in a medieval-style world warding off predators but also political unrest within the mouse kingdoms. The titular Guard are fierce, loyal soldiers. The artwork in this is rich, though it can be hard to see what's going on in the many fight scenes as the camera twists and turns.

## _Rickety Stitch & The Gelatinous Goo_ series, James Parks
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Avv2lv1BL.jpg)

While animated skeletons are common enough in Rickety Stitch's land, he seems to be the only one who talks and sings. The series follows him and his best friend, The Gelatinous Goo (a blob-shaped creature that only Rickety can understand) as they seek to find out why Rickety is different. Black-and-white dream sequences give the readers the ability to infer some details, but they're still confusing and opaque. I like that this series imagines a world after big wars between good and evil and the life the normal denizens lead in the uncivilized world. And props to the production team for actually creating recordings of some of the original songs featured in the book.

### _5 Worlds_ series, Mark Siegel, Alexis Siegel, lots of other people
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vX6w3U-LL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This is a rich sci-fi/fantasy epic adventure that has themes of oppression, climate change, and more. We ate these books up and are eagerly awaiting the next one. The three main protagonists (drawn in different races) include Oona, a sand dancer who can manipulate the magical sand scattered around the 5 Worlds; An Tzu, a boy from the slums of the main world who is slowly dying from a "fading sickness" that causes him to be more invisible over time; and Jax Amboy, a starball player who An Tzu worships. The three have to work together to light the "5 beacons" established by the old gods. There are surprises aplenty in these books.

### _Science Comics_ series, various authors
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NkHrYBCuL._SX351_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

Each volume in this series is packed with lots of good information. Most have a light narrative framework (with Volcanoes being the most extreme), but they're really about showing off lots of great facts about their topic with great illustrations.

### _All's Faire in Middle School_, Victoria Jamieson
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kh-y2z6gL.jpg)

Parents note: This is definitely better for older kids; there's some borderline explicit content. Aside from that, this is a typically warm and sympathetic Jamieson book focused on Imogene, who was homeschooled until middle grade and whose parents work at the local Renaissance Faire. She tries to navigate middle school's many challenges, framing them in the context of a Middle Age story of knights and dragons and getting advice from her "Faire-mily." The middle grade tropes are in full force: befriending the popular girl and learning she's actually horrible, odd thoughts about boys, insecurity about her clothes and house, and finding a true friend after doing something mean to her as prompted by the queen bee mean girl. Meanwhile, you'll get some behind-the-scenes views of Ren Faires and how they work.

### _Earth Before Us_ series, Abby Howard
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nrh8gh8WL._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

A must-read for any fan of prehistory, this series spans the earliest animals, the dinosaurs, and the large mammals of relatively recent geologic time. Detailed drawings and pronunciation guides will draw in readers of all ages, and even grownups will probably learn some things. The story, such as it is, involves a young girl of color finding out that her next-door neighbor is a Caucasian paleontologist who travels through time via portals in her (and other) recycling bins. But largely the story takes a back seat to the extensive catalog of which animals are alive when.

### _Maker Comics_ series, various authors
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C-v5mrR2L.jpg)

This companion series to _Science Comics_ is off to a great start with _Bake Like a Pro_. The series will teach kids DIY activities within the context of a straightforward story.
